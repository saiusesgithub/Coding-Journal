in placement training class , those quantum computing club seniors called me so got attendance and bunked the class 
and they said , if they have mids

we need to go to the ISB quantum computing event and network with ibm people and like get thier contacts 
for club events etc so that if we collaborate with ibm , then our college will be one of the first to introduce quantum computing club and like we can branch out to other colleges from here

i wonder what other unknown/not - popular / not - mainstream technologies have very high hidden potential

came home , timepass until 5:45 (freshup , relaxation)

from 5:45 , kinda felt an urge to play minecraft , but first opened the cognitive ai course , and it wasnt loading , then it showed some website error 

some error with the website so i wasnt able to login or do anything 
website was basically in accessible 

so as i wanted to play minecraft anyway , started playing that 

until like 8:00 
and then songs and dinner bruh 


COMPLETE TIMEWASTE TODAY

after dinner , conginitive ai website was working but was too late to complete all the tasks today
so explored about those 3 internships i got (which starts from tomorrow , excluding shadowfox)

skillcraft
prodigy infotech 
oasis infobyte

explored thier offer letters , tasks , how to post on linkedin without messing up my profile etc
a lot other companies exist just like this , they are just basically fake certificate providers

legal but of no value , timepass certificates

like literally the apps i am supposed to do overlap in all 3 internships like all 3 have common apps

qr scanner, calculator ,todo , stopwatch etc

it seems even i can start a company like this , very low effort it seems 
like 1-2 day work thats it 

and i can make them do my personal work
(FOR FREE)

gathered data about this internships , thats it so far for today , didnt do ANYTHING USEFUL

also is it even worth flooding my linkedin profile with these internships? (THAT TOO ALL AT ONCE)

i wanted to keep doing internship one after another , i can if i do low effort beginner internships like this 

BUT MAN I REALLY NEED ATLEAST ONE PAID INTERNSHIP BY END OF 2ND YEAR HOPEFULLY

FOCUS ON FLUTTER MAN , BUILD ONE BIG PROJECT (learn state management)
