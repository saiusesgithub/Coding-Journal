9:30 to 10:40
completed 1,2,3,5 modules in aws educate cloud 101 (and only took minimal notes, didnt waste lot of time)

rest of the day didnt keep track of the timings but 

completed Cloud 101 Course on aws educate 

mostly pretty good 
a little better/beginner friendly than oci fundamentals 
the only con being they didnt really teach the "definitions" of some stuff
but i already had some knowledge from oci so wasnt a problem for me

tbh a lot of knowledge transfered from oci to here 
just some subtle name changes and some more new stuff

learnt about - cloudwatch,dynamodb,ec2,iam,s3,rds,lambda,vpc,sns and (saas,paas,iaas), shared responsibility model,aws well architected framework and cloud carrers and wrote test 

#### TOMMOROW - READ THE ENTIRE NOTES OF CLOUD 101 (FINAL REVISION ONCE BEFORE CONTINUING)
#### ALSO TAKE SCREENSHOTS OF WRONG ANSWERS FROM THE TEST

kinda also tried to do the blockchain course , not as smooth or structured as this 
i need to actually read those 40 pages pdf's to understand

wrote the test of first module (got 100%!) without even studying that pdf but they were basics so 
from next time , i need to read that pdf , i cant even download it 

didnt really feel like doing today , i cant even plan it properly



also my inter friend called today and had disscussion with him about coding

LEARN JAVA

DSA
LEETCODE
CODECHEF
HACKER RANK

he suggested i should start dsa from tomorrow only (actually good suggestion)

i can try to do one problem per day and then i can continue on with my learning 
but can i manage leetcode + cloud + blockchain at same time? (+ that flutter internship)

harsha(from nxtwave) is doing internship rn it seems 

also they will give 2 months holidays for universities JUST to do internships it seems 

this is my competition , i really gotta work hard


ALSO START APPLYING TO OTHER FLUTTER INTERNSHIPS IN INTERNSHALA ETC AND COLD MESSAGE PEOPLE ON LINKEDIN
and ask other people about how they got thier internship and tips etc like senior vijay 
(3rd year IT , abc lead)

ALSO BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH , broke the streak just now , like I WAS 1 MIN LATE (22 day streak gone ;-;)
