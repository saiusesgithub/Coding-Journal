so in morning, didnt do anything 
just listened to songs

i mean tbh , i am not a machine , i cant spend every living minute studying 

so like instead of planning to do something in the morning and then not being able to do it and getting stressed , i can just not plan anything in the slot and then not worry at all

planned to write yesterday's diary in the morning , lagged to writing the bus , then lagged to writing in the class 
and then lagged too much , it was too late to even write at this point 


but like i did commit blank file yesterday to keep the streak
thats kinda cheating tbh

cuz i didnt write the journal so the streak should break
cheating to keep up streak is not ethical

so from now on , if i dont write journal , dont commit at all
atleast this will get me writing more often

after coming from college - 

planned to timepass until 5:30 and start from 5:30 but got that message from ecell that we will have a group discussion at 6:00 for selecting people for going to IIT bombay so had to attend that meeting at 6:00

so timepassed until 6:00 (youtube shorts)

6:00 to 7:00
that meeting (group discussion)
i knew i wasnt getting selected anyway cuz its all politics and idk anyone closely there
and i really didnt do any work in the club 

but attended for the sake of it 
thats it 

one thing - my communication skills and my english SUCKS (i am stuttering a lot like bruhhh)

7:00 to 8:00 - 
started the le wagon intro to docker course 
and completed the entire course too

it was just a single ppt and some tasks in text 
really simple , like REALLY BASIC
didnt learn anything 

just got a certificate (not that good anyway)

so yeah le wagon thing was very basic and waste of time tbh

so searched for other courses

8:00 to 9:00 - 
timepass (listened to songs for long time) and then dinner 
bruh too much time wasted 

9:00 to 11:00

searched for more courses - decided doing CognitiveClass.ai - Docker Essentials: A Developer Introduction

ill get a good looking IBM certificate too and badge on credly 
and videos on youtube so easy transcript 
visuals are nice too + actual labs instead of theory

like tasks are given to do
and graded on those labs and final quiz 

spent some time calculating the cgpa loss based on grade

decided i wasnt going tomorrow (cuz thrusday)
but then PC sir messaged tomorrow is last day for presentations and he wont take any after that

he will put 0 marks so i really didnt wanna mess up my cgpa this time 
so decided we are going tomorrow 

bruh i planned to sit at home and complete that ibm docker course 

i gotta do all this asap , cuz like we have mids and sems in december , i am not studying anything now/not listening to classes so i gotta spend more time in exams time 

so i feel like the entire december month will go in exam prep
so i cant really do anything in december 

so i gotta do as much as possible in november itself


so really didnt do anything great today
just decided what course i will do next
thats it 

nothing else
le wagon course in basically useless

BRUHHHH MAKE THAT SECOND BRAIN / TODO REPO OR PLAN SOMETHING FOR THAT 
I AM FORGETTING STUFF FROM PREVIOIUS JOURNALS

also as this is public repo , i am not able to express all my thoughts clearly tbh (BUT TBH I SHOULD KEEP THIS STRICTLY CODING RELATED , I AM WRITING RANDOM LIFE STUFF IN THIS)
