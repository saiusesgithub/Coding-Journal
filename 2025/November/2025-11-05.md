Rough work on the day -

Woke up a little late today and then until 2 p.m. I worked on the devup Society event page 

Vibe coded completely 
Tried different vibe coding platforms
But still v0 gave best result

And then made some changes using github copilot 

Also opened that website which has list of ai tools

Really worried
Like
There were some cloud and devops related tools too
Like man
Even this isnt free from ai huh???

The result was really good tbh 
Like with some improvement 
It could be perfect 

I can learn integration of reactbits,framer,gsap
And let the ai do the basic work
Perfect combo 

Until 3 did this work

And from 3pm
Completed the remaining aws getting started with RDS

Wasnt as easy assessment as before ones 
And also ,i didnt really feel like the hands on simulation today was worthful 
Didnt learn anything new 

And i am just taking screenshots and pasting in notes

AFTER I AM DONE WITH ALL THESE
I should really spend some time revising everything

Like asking doubts to chatgpt and clarifying etc

Then idk 

Really got stressed/depressed by looking at linkedin 
(took some screenshots in gallery,look into that)

AND ALSO 
DONT JUST LEAVE THIS JOURNAL LIKE THIS
FIX THIS ENTRY

LIKE I AM JUST WRITING JOURNAL AND FORGETTING/IGNORING 

ITS USELESS UNLESS I REFLECT OVER IT

And then worked a lil bit more on devup Society website
Like i am able to change text in different places of website without ai help 
Like i am understanding a lil bit 

Also i got pretty good with supabase 
Got used to it

And then calls from flutter Internship ppl

Actually i also got a mail about codevocado flutter internship interview 

went to interview 
No one came ,only 2 ppl
They asked to introduce ,i did

They asked me can you show me your work
I didnt have any apk's ready to show
(EVEN README OF HACKRADAR ISNT COMPLETED BRUH)
NO SCREENSHOTS OR RECORDING

then he asked me about rest api's

Like what is rest in rest api 
Shit,idk 
He said ,sure yeah i understood what i needed

First Disappointment for me
I felt really bad
I was not taken for sure

But in night ,i got mail - you got selected as intern
Orientation and letter will be given 

But this is 6 months too like bruh
+ I am team lead here so ??
And like i am used to this lil bit than that

We will see



In night got flutter internship call
He got 3 more php guys 
And he like was a lil angry

Like i am not taking initiative like coordinating 
With others 
And my app progress
I just said i am cleaning up the code today 
Just for sake of saying 

He said work on bugs first

He conducted a session for us

Introduction to bit bucket and jira
Like how to make repo,how to clone,branch etc
(Learn more about these,i can add to resume)

Like a buy this internship I will probably get some knowledge or experience about production level code or how accompany works like the process like how to create a branch for my development and how to pull request and then how the testing works and then how they code guests boost to the court gets to the production level so that's so one of the thing i am hoping  to learn from this intenrship 

But like man
Its still free internship 
I should focus on skills now

Like i am easily able to get these unpaid internships 
It will be the same in future too

Like if i focus on my skills first
In future,i will get paid internships 
Or else,worst case,i will get the same unapid ones i am getting rn with same level of hardwork so its not like i wont get internships in future 

Also my flutter projects arent like 
Too good
Like they are still very simple
Like i can't take those and go to linkedin and cold message people 
My current flutter project's arent worth an paid internship 



Faizan about unpaid internships 

## Email THEM for offer letter (blue info planet)


I FORGOT TO POST ATTENDANCE ON STARTUP WORLD BRUHHH

Also applied for one Internship in internshala
Made my internshala resume
Just need to fine tune it 

Also make my portfolio website too 
Vibe coding 
One full day

# Make a second brain github repo or find something
Like IT SHOULD CONTAIN ALL MY TODOS ETC IN ONE PLACE INSTEAD OF JUST WRITING THEM IN THIS JOURNAL AND NEVER LOOKING BACK 



Thoughts -

[05/11, 12:35 am] sAI sRUJAN: Make like a second brain on github 

My FLUTTER APPS SUCK ASS
And i dont even know any other languages apart from that
I wasted WAY TOO MUCH TIME ON IT

this flutter internship might give me experience from like testing, development,to hosting and production etc
[05/11, 12:35 am] sAI sRUJAN: Vibe code a website which looks at internships from different websites and auto sends them an email applying for that internship with my resume
[05/11, 12:37 am] sAI sRUJAN: TOO MUCH INFO IN REDDIT AND GALLERY TOO
[05/11, 6:36 pm] sAI sRUJAN: POSTING ON LINKEDIN , POST MY PROJECTS , UPDATE IT , PHOTO ETC
