learning java along with cloud and do dsa
or within the same time as java , 
i can learn devops thing simultaneoulsy like docker or blockchain stuff
MAN I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN 

ai is automating of devops too ;-;

build one big flutter project 
make a plan after this aws what to do 
what happened to that 3 month - one technology plan???

MAKE THAT SECOND BRAIN REPO/PLAN TOMORROW 

write journal from the morning like gradually 

Faking on resume and github

Every sunday  - Reflection of previous week journal 

Getting too deep into the journal
Feels like personal journal rather than coding progress
KEEP A CHATGPT CHAT , I WILL WRITE THIS AND GIVE IT , IT WILL ORGANISE IT ACCORDING TO THE TEMPLATE 

REALLY BURNT OUT TODAY

from morning , worked on devup website , 
like until 4 i worked non stop 
hosting and fixing errors etc
like lot of problems with hosting 

but finally got it 
(i can put render , railway and vercel on my portfolio too after spending a lil bit time on them)

didnt even eat lunch till 4pm 
kinda too much work today 

so really burnt out by this point 

and then kinda started aws educate getting started with serverless because didnt have much time left and also didnt feel like doing networking , to do networking , i need one non stop day without any interruptions 

did a lil bit of that

and then flutter internship call (blue planet info thing)

also had orientation scheduled at 6:00 pm for codevocado (tbh even i was suprised that i got selected)

even got selected in shadowfox (starts from december 1st)

tbh , even we can start a company and hire unpaid interns to do the work 

even got selected in some other random thing (but asked for money 49rupees for 1 month)
nahhhh , that company hosted its website on vercel (like literally free domain)
nahhhhh

but forgot to join , cuz i was in blue planet info thing
and he asked me to get those other flutter interns 

and felt really lag today 
wasting too much time in these meetings

and felt like hes asking me to do too much , like his plans for me are toooooo much
he wants me to implement so many features in the app like bruhh

sooo much lag that it was getting on my nerves
really felt like leaving the meet and deserting the position 

but kinda controlled , but at one point , i was done 
i was so burnt out from the morning

i just directly blocked every number on whatsapp and contacts asap 

really thought about it , but this was the best decision 
i already have too much on my plate 

like i am getting so stressed

pros of staying in that internship - 

early internship badge on resume 
working in production level 
especially - flutter team lead badge on resume 

cons - 
cant learn anything new for myself (self learning - cloud , devops )
and its 6 months , i am done , i cant waste that much time on just flutter and not learning anything 

+ unpaid and the work he is giving is too much

very toxic work culture 

i wont have early internship and team leader badge on resume 

but i can get other small internships (in flutter only if i want) , less work but same still counts as early internship 

like those shadowfox things 

i realized why unpaid internships are useless and why ppl dont do them 
like they expect too much work for free , not worth it 

like instead of working on this old flutter website fixing bugs , i can build so much better apps

i realised the worth of "direction > speed"

i should take some time off , build an amazing flutter app using ai (integrating all the technologies) 
(also learn about stuff like provider , bloc etc , spend 1 day on them)

and after building an amazing app , i can just cold message people on linked in and get a paid internship 

so do that , build an amazing flutter app and get paid internship

also i want to do as many internships as possible like without break 
one after another 

but i will only show 2-3 on resume near experience 
(sure i will show them in portfolio and linkedin but thats it )

and realised how EASY it is to get unpaid internships like 
i got 3 offers so far (only applied to 3-4) - blue planet , shadowfox , codevocado 

if i apply for some more , ill easily get more

if i pay , then they will come and pick me 

so unpaid internships arent worth it unless its an actual company doing stuff instead of just like traning scam 

so bye bye my first internship 
started and ended in 6 days 

but i mean - i left it 
for the good 

this was a good decision ngl 
i didnt waste any more time , good thing 

very toxic work culture

then took a long break cuz really my brain was fed up 
played a little minecraft

then continued doing that aws educate getting started with serverless course

really complex , like the hardness level is increasing 

but i am mainly not understanding CUZ I AM NOT READING THE TEXT 
AND SPENDING TIME ON IT 

i am just blindly taking screenshot and making notes 
i am not reading , and re reading and clarifying doubts and trying to understand

then its really time wasted tbh , i didnt do anything productive , after completing these badges , i really need sit and take on one topic per day
like actually practicing in the console , and like asking chatgpt back and forth and clarifying doubts 


also i realised , i cant put - tech lead of this club anywhere
like is koushik / vijay keeping on thier resume that they were lead of this club?? idts
