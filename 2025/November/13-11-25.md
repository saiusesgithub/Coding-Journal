wasted time listening to songs in the morning 

planned to watch the quantum computing video in the bus and in college as i have the interview for the quantum computing club today

started watching the video in the bus , but after like 10 minutes , really felt kinda overwhelmed

too much math, and i didnt even watch 10% of it 
even the rest of it is math 

like really complex math , i need like 10 days to watch that video and take notes to understand everything in that let alone in 1 day



after coming back from college

interview at 7:00 it seems 

freshed up and relaxed until 5:30 
5:30 to 7:00 - tried to get an overview on quantum computing for that interview


tried to watch the youtube video given by them(freecodecamp) again but felt too math heavy again
like that math is like above our college level 

so what i did is searched and watched some shorter videos (3blue1brown , veritasium)
and then mainly , found a course on alison (intro to quantum computing smth)

completed that , i wont get certificate anyway(i have to pay) but i didnt expect to even get the certificate , i just went there for resoruces 

and it was completely text but it really gave a really good high level overview on quantum computing (theoretical) , it didnt really go deep , but the quality of text was nice 

but still its too physics/math related more than computers, like we will probably use quantum computers to do OTHER stuff like medical field etc 
not particularly a 'software' job/field

and then attended interview

MY COMMUNICATION AND ENGLISH SUCKS (i am stuttering a lot man , i can speak pretty good to myself but when its speaking with others or like public speaking , i am done man , i suck)
i really gotta focus on my communications skills

i am underestimating thier importance, sometimes communication > skills
as my dad says, doesnt matter how amazing you are in skills , if you are not able to express what's in your mind then its useless

really need to work on communication skills

tbh , had some real good answers in my brain but just couldnt express cuz of the language barrier

meeting until 7:30/7:40

7:30 - 8:20 - started Cognitive Class IBM CO0101EN Docker Essentials: A Developer Introduction course lab 1
took notes in obsidian 

didnt really feel like it was quality content (like the videos were good) but the text is really outdated and not that clear , like its not mentioning common errors/mistakes,
i am having to search these fixes my self 

8:20 to 9:00 - dinner + listened to songs (TIME WASTE BRUHH)

9:00 to 10:40 - completed lab 1 in docker course and then idk timepassed in reels and wrote this diary
