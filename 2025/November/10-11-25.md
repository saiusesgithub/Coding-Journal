[6:10 am, 10/11/2025] sAI sRUJAN: My Holidays end here
8 solid Holidays in a row

I might never get these agaain 

What have i achieved 
Got basic grip on aws cloud

One way,its nice but other way

If i compare to how hard i used to work while cs50 before college 

5-6 per day

Man imagine i spent that much time per day in these holidays too

Could have achieved so much 

Where did the time go???
Idk mannn
6 hrs per day

From now one, every sunday and holiday 

6 hrs per day goal


## WRITE ABOUT MORNING LINKEDIN STRESS

evening - 
[7:44 pm, 10/11/2025] sAI sRUJAN: 6:00 to 7:10

completed major part of the aws educate - getting started with cloud operations 
completed introduction to well architected framework , introduction to aws cost management, introduction to managing your aws account

even i was suprised i did so much in just like 1hr 
i mean it was very simple stuff 
but i kinda pushed through without taking any break (pushed through 3 modules)
i should do that more you know
not easily convincing myself for break 


[7:44 pm, 10/11/2025] sAI sRUJAN: 7:10 to 7:40
timepass = Songs + shorts
[8:34 pm, 10/11/2025] sAI sRUJAN: 7:40 to 8:20 - dinner and reels

[8:34 pm, 10/11/2025] sAI sRUJAN: 8:20 to 9:00  resumed aws
completed the additional cloud operation services and tried to do lab but lab was really messed up

wasnt even able to open the lab , not able to download the pdf , its just buggy as hell
not possible to even try
so did the assessment and got the badge 

all in one day!!!

i mean the first three sections were easy , no need of even chatgpt help
the last other services section , he gave like very brief intro of all the services, not deep 
so i felt like deep isnt required and ignored them kinda , skimmed through them very quickly cuz in future , if i am gonna use them , i am gonna learn them anyway again so at that time , i can dedicate time and learn one by one 

9:00 to 10:10 - really tired so played minecraft 
10:10 to 11:10 - scrolled on linkedin 

planned how to post the badges
sent requests to some first years who sent me linkedin for devup and like some people i can recognise and some random people to increase connections 

(my profile isnt as bad as i thought it was, i mean its fine , just some simple fixes)

the problem with me is i want to be WAY better than others
like on another level compared to others 

thats my problem , comparision 
even if i am better than others , thats not enough for me, i should be WAY better than them , like on another level
then i calm down

i mean that kinda competition is good only , i work harder tbh
