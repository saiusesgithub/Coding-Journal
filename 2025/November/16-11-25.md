sunday

woke up at around 9:00 

9:00 to 12:00pm - listened to songs for a long time , then opened laptop but like convinced myself to play minecraft thinking i had a lot of time to study today cuz its just morning 

before i knew , time was 12

in between i felt like i would stop playing and start studying at some "particular time" and then that time is crossing and then i am lagging it to the next "milestone" time like ex - 

i thought i would start from 11:45 , when i looked at time , its 11:47 , i am thinking - nvm ill start from 12:00

like i am not stopping what i am doing at the moment , i am just procastinating


12:00 to 12:35 - revised lab 2 (still not perfect , need to read once more line by line and like write physical cheatsheet and ask chatgpt doubts)

12:35 to 1:15 - 
Kinda did lab 3
Tried watching but didnt understand anything 
Like i need to gain more knowledge on containerisation before starting orchestration 

Also the course is a little too not beginner friendly tbh 
Its a developer introduction to docker ,not beginner introduction to docker
And also mostly text based 

SO LITERALLY JUST BLANKLY WROTE NOTES AND SUMMARY NOTES using chatgpt

Lab 3 completely blank , didnt learn a single new thing (didnt understand)

also i needed play with docker for this 3rd lab , that wasnt working so i kinda wasted some time fixing it , after some time it started working 
but lab 3 was too complex to understand lab so didnt do
(like i didnt understand the concept , copy pasting commands would be waste of time)

i'll come back to this part later when i am starting to learn docker swarm exclusively etc in future at some point 

(till this poit - Didnt do lab 3 quiz and final quiz )

1:15 to 2:30 - lunch + timepass BRUHH 
WASTING TOO MUCH TIME ON REELS AND SHORTS

2:30 to 2:40 - copied in the quiz(lab 3 quiz)
didnt do lab 3 content so i had no idea of anything so just copied from chatgpt

Too much notes,not reading,not learning 

Just focused on completion

like i am not memorizing commands , like when i started learning to code using c and python
i could write code without any cheatsheets/google 

like that was my peak learning era, i was so focused and so good at coding like i used to do those 
cs50x and cs50p problem sets without copying
I AM PROUD THAT I DIDNT COPY IN EVEN 1 PSET, did all by my own

i am not learning like that now , i am just focusing on completions and certificates 
not focusing on actual learning 

my logic and problem solving at that time was amazing 
i used to be so focused and lockedin back then like 6 hours per day man

and then i used to learn german and read books too 
discipline and motivation was peak in that time 

2:40 to 4:00 - idk timepass man BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i am not making todo list / time based time table so i am just wasting a lot of time


4:00 to 5:00 - completed final test , got badge and 2 certificates , one from cognitive and other from ibm , explored linkedin , thought if my internship post got enough likes so that i can post this , also explored other resoucrse like GUIDED PROJECTS IN COGNITIVE AI - AMAZING (DOCKER STUFF IS THRE , I CAN START WITH THOSE)

5:00 to 6:50 - thought i would relax until 6:00 and start from 6:00 , slowly it went until 6:50 BRUHH
i should stop immidiately if i think of studying man 
i should stop timepass right there and then and start 

did that linkedin post about certificates
linkedinpost


Bath and dinner until 7:50

wrote that instacks assessment from 8:20 to 8:40
8:40 to 9:20 - tried to like understand the notes (ibm docker course), and make a cheatsheet , read notes multiple times but realised i also have tomorrow to create a cheatsheet and summarising this week jounal is important so gave that up for tomorrow

man i am just chasing certificates , as i got certificate of this course , i am not longer looking at notes, revising , practing 

like those aws educate badges, as soon as i got badges, i didnt do anything else , i abanoned the notes , 
i need to revisit those and like cleanup and revise 

no need to be always doing certificates , learning and practice is more important

9:20 to 9:50 - songs
9:50 to 11:00 - sat to write down today's journal , explored about hackathons 

found submissions of that appthon i attended in lords college, found ideas of the ports team and the winners team (yasser - school friend)

planned to integrate both thier ideas into our next hackathon
there is one on 29,30 nov in mjcet called datanyx
so planning to take this 

(i can learn blockchain for this and like build an app and like host this on aws and containerize using docker)

spent time about that and then after that disscussion , wrote this diary

tbh that 1st prize winner IDEA is good but execution is MEH , they made a website instead of a mobile app , 
like bruh we are way better than most of the people there

only luck didnt favour us till now , our skills are good enough


FOR TOMORROW - 

revise ibm docker course completely (solve doubts using chatgpt , even try to understand lab 3 with the help of chatgpt)

and maybe after this , spend some time in docker like learn some more on youtube or something and make a project along with docker and aws and post on linkedin




Thoughts - 

German Speaking BRUHHH , learning the language is one thing , speaking is completely another thing
but man, idk how to even like read/write bruhhhhhhh

like daily learn atleast one word , imagine i learnt one word per day , how ahead i would have been compared to now 

no need to get too stressed about jobs 
Maybe ill change my career after going to germany
Maybe into cars like not computer related at all or maybe a business

with my mindset , i am sure ill figure out something 
but for now , i just need to keep doing the best i can


getting a lot of business/startup related reels on insta

lot of good stuff in Insta saved reels

feeling kinda Guilty about the internships
like doing all at once takes out the value from them

and like if everyone knows about them , then they lose thier value too

maybe i need to do one per month 
like this month prodigy 

nov - prodigy
dec - shadowfox 
jan - skillcraft 
feb - oasis 

and then some others

doing app dev in all of them feels little wierd , but doing different things is even worse cuz ppl will think i dont have focus

LOOK AT STUFF FROM GALLERY

THINGS TO IMPROVE/ MISTAKES NOT TO MAKE FROM NEXT TIME  (add this section to the template)
also need to revamp the template , not following it these days

and like man its too late now ,i can't reflect over this week journal tbh
i thought i would start reflection/review at 9:00 but stuff kept coming in between and i kept procastinating
