## 📚 Topics Studied / Explored
- Concept : AWS Security And AWS Serverless 

#### in aws security - 
revised the entire getting started with security course - revised what i did so far (until using iam section) - revised my notes throughly and solved many doubts using chatgpt , wrote a lot of additional notes using chatgpt

security felt pretty easy too today with the help of chatgpt (same level of productivity as networking course)

authentication vs authorization , layers of security , aws shared responsibility model 
IAM users , credential types , use cases , root user , IAM policies (identity based policies and resource based policies) , conflicting policies , 
iam groups (and difference bw dynamic groups in oci) , iam roles , iam access analyzer , credential reports

and in additional aws security services - 
aws cognito , kms (key management service) , secrets manager , aws shield , inspector , guardduty 

and did hands - on simulation lab - 
was pretty useful today , really felt like i was learning/practicing something

Simulation - 
. Create a custom managed policy.
. Create IAM user groups with permission policies.
. Create IAM users and assign users to groups.
· Use user groups to add users to a group.
. Explore policy permissions that users inherit from groups.
. Log in as users to test the user's permissions.
. Modify a user's permission to provide additional access.

#### in aws serverless - 

started revising but didnt complete (some part of it was too complex man like tbh i didnt have enough interest at that point so i wasnt understanding anything but still harder than concepts so far) 

monolithic method and micro services methodology , tightly vs loosely coupled , advantages and dis-adv. of monolithic and microservices , 
about serverless , event driven architecture , serverless and event driven architecture benefits , 
lambda functions , types of invocation (synchronous, asynchronous , didnt really understand polling based invocation) , 
execution environment life cycle , event source , iam resource policy and iam execution role , use cases of lambda 
(only revised until this part)

NEED TO REVISE THE REST OF LAMBDA PART AND AWS SERVERLESS SERVICES LIKE (API GATEWAY,FARGATE,LAMBDA@EDGE,SNS,SQS,STEP FUNCTIONS)

but completed assessment today (didnt have any problem)

and also completed hands on simulation lab (no problem in that too) - 

. Create a Lambda function.
. Configure an Amazon S3 trigger on a Lambda function.
. Observe logs and metrics for a Lambda function to determine performance.
. Size and configure a Lambda function for optimal performance.

## 📚 Resources Consumed
- Courses: AWS Educate - Getting Started With Security And Getting Started With Serverless 

---

## 🤔 Reflection
- What went well today? - really learnt security course with interest like doubt solving with chatgpt etc
- What could be improved? wasting too much time on instagram reels , youtube shorts and listening to songs 
- Did I stick to my plan?  - DIDN'T EVEN MAKE A PLAN ;---;

## Random Thoughts 

damn being a lead in the club is great , i am getting to network/meet with so many juniors

---

## How many of my planned goals did I accomplish today? 
- ( 2 accomplished / 3 planned )

---

## 🗓️ Plan for Tomorrow
- complete getting started with cloud 
- tomorrow morning (before going to college,right after waking up), make second brain repo / reflect/summarise/clean up previous week journal
- also start german and stock market learning from tomorrow
- restructure the template according to my writing style

woke up at 9:20 ish but wasted time until 10:30 listening to songs and reels ;-;

10:30 to 12:00 - revised the entire getting started with security course -revised what i did so far , until using iam section , revised my notes throughly and solved many doubts using chatgpt , wrote a lot of additional notes using chatgpt , tbh , chatgpt is enough to learn anything , no need of these courses or anything , kinda felt spent too much on chatgpt clarifications , went a little too deep but spent too much tiime on too less content , imagine i spend same amount of doubt clarification on other courses too like ec2,serverless etc

12:00 to 2:20 - timepass + lunch + reels and scroll on insta and then sent messages to selected devup tech team members 
(WASTED TIME ON REELS AND SHORTS)

2:20 to 3:40 - Completed simulation, assessment, revised remaining content and Got badge (aws security)

6:30 to 7:30 - revised getting started with serverless 

7:30 to 9:40 - bath , one remaining devup tech team interview (my english sucked ;-;) , dinner , then some timepass and sat down to learn serverless , really didnt feel like doing , like i wasnt even understanding anything , too complex without interest, like i need to spend one  complete day on it (later, rewatch the videos) , but got the badge (serverless , wrote exam without any problem , also did simulation , no problem in that too)

9:40 to 10:30 - wasted time listening to songs 
10:30 to 11:20 - wrote this journal (took so much time cuz i wrote it very detailed like the topics learnt etc)

---






(also make resume data folder , and keep it every month so i can see progress in that too)

send msg to those ppl about devup labs 

msg vijay guttala about blockchain

keep looking for paid internships 

UPDATE LINKEDIN

make summary of each unit using chatgpt

take screenshots of subtitles for all the completed courses

restructure journal template according to my writing style
