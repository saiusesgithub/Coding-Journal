# 📝 Coding Journal — 08-11-2025
---

## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 08-11-2025
- **Day of Week:**  Saturday
- **Total Coding Time:** idk didnt keep track but pretty low (STRICTLY KEEP TRACK OF THIS FROM MONDAY ONWARDS) , did some cloud , spent some time on devup event website and taking tech team interviews for devup
- **Main Focus Today:** complete getting started with security course from aws educate (didnt really complete ;-;)
- **Streak Counter:** Day 7 of learning AWS

---

## 🎯 Daily Goals
- [➖] Complete getting started with security course on aws educate 

completed these sections from the theory course (didnt start lab or assessment)

Introduction to Security
Intro to AWS IAM
Using IAM (in the last , i was tired , my brain could process anything so just took screenshots , re-watch the videos from roles concept till the end)

didnt do this section - 
Additional AWS Security Services

wasnt as productive or learnt with as much focus as yesterday
even tho yesterday was networking (i felt its the hardest topic in cloud)
i really understood everything as i was laser focused and clarified doubts with chatgpt then and there 

didnt really do that today

i mean every day cant be perfect but i gotta try my best 

(also some content is remaining in serverless course so do that too)

so my plan is - 

9th - complete getting started with security and getting started with serverless (remaining parts)
10th - complete getting started with cloud operations
(post all the badges on linkedin , completed aws educate core badges in 10 days!)

11th and 12th - revise all the core badges notes deeply and clarify doubts and make aws free account and like get actual hands on experience 

complete these optional course on 13th to 17th ()
Introduction to Amazon CloudWatch	0.75
Introduction to Generative AI / Amazon Bedrock / Amazon Q Developer	0.75
Introduction to Professional Skills	1
Resume Creation	1
Cloud Support Associate: Day in the Life	0.5
Machine Learning Foundations	3
Amazon Innovation	2
+ any revision

by 17th night , i should be done with aws educate 

from 18th, i'll start devops 

ALSO FIX MY LINKEDIN PROFILE ASAP
AND ALSO PLAN ABOUT VIBE CODING AN AMAZING FLUTTER APP

like when these hackathons are coming , we are acheiving so much in so little time 
imagine we work the same way for our personal projects too 

along with cloud/devops , also explore some other domain - like blockchain or cybersecurity 
or learn java and start DSA
(i will have grip on coding with dsa and i will also learn cloud/devops as my skill so i will have both)

also AS TOMORROW IS SUNDAY , LOOK AT ALL THE PREVIOUS JOURNAL ENTRY'S , AND WHATSAPP MESSAGES WHICH I SENT TO MYSELF AND LIKE REFLECT/SUJMMARISE AND FIX THINGS 

LIKE MAKE MY SECOND BRAIN , DIGITAL TWIN TOMORROW
OR WAIT MAYBE 

I CAN MAKE IT INTO AN APP? 😏

did some cloud in morning 
till 3:00 pm , worked on devup society 
then took interviews until 5:30 

then mostly timepass man
really felt sleepy , couldnt focus 
did a lil bit of cloud (didnt really get into my brain)
and then went out to eat so even more timewaste 

even planned to do some getting started with security now , but really sleepy , it wont get into my brain 

so yeah that's it

- Framework / Library: (e.g., “Explored Flutter Provider package”)  
- Tools Used: (e.g., “Postman for API testing”)  
- Documentation/Articles/Videos: (e.g., “Watched CS50 lecture on SQL”)  

---

## 🏗️ Projects Worked On
### Project: *Project Name*
- **Tasks Completed:** (e.g., “Added user authentication with Firebase”)  
- **Features Implemented:** (e.g., “Login + Register form with validation”)  
- **Commits/Pushes:** (e.g., “3 commits pushed to GitHub repo”)  
- **Challenges Faced:** (see Biggest Challenge below)  
- **Next Steps:** (e.g., “Integrate password reset flow tomorrow”)  

---

## 🐞 Bugs / Problems Faced
- Issue #1: (e.g., “App crashed when filtering products”)  
- Cause: (e.g., “Null pointer due to empty list”)  
- Fix/Attempted Solution: (e.g., “Added null check before rendering list”)  
- Final Resolution:  

---

## 💡 Solutions / Insights
- Key insight learned today: (e.g., “List comprehensions in Python save a lot of code”)  
- “Aha” moment: (e.g., “Realized I can reuse the same widget for multiple screens”)  
- Things I would do differently next time:  

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned
- (e.g., “Don’t forget to clear cache before testing changes in Flutter”)  
- (e.g., “Using Git branches makes experimentation safer”)  

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Day
- Best thing I accomplished: (e.g., “Finally fixed that login bug after 2 days”)  

---

## ⚔️ Biggest Challenge
- Hardest problem today: (e.g., “Debugging async API calls in Dart”)  
- How I approached it: (e.g., “Read official docs and tried breakpoints”)  
- Outcome: (e.g., “Fixed after restructuring FutureBuilder logic”)  

---

## 🔄 Refactor Opportunities
- (e.g., “Database queries can be optimized with indexes”)  
- (e.g., “UI code for ProductCard widget is repetitive, can extract a reusable component”)  

---

## 💭 Random Thoughts
- (e.g., “Coding at night feels more productive, should shift schedule?”)  

---

## 🌟 Inspiration Board
- [Link / Screenshot / Idea] (e.g., “Saw a Dribbble design I want to try”)  

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- Total Lines of Code (approx):  
- Problems Solved (if on LeetCode/Codeforces/etc.):  
- GitHub Contributions Today:  

---

## 📚 Resources Consumed
