## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 03-11-2025

- **Streak Counter:** Day 2 of learning AWS

---

## 🎯 Daily Goals
- [✅] Complete Introduction to the AWS Management Console

---

## 📚 Topics Studied / Explored
- Concept : About AWS Management Console(+ Hands-on/Simulation) , Storage Services In AWS like S3,EBS,EFS (+ Hands-on/Simulation)

mainly focused on S3 , little bit on EBS , didnt really understand/focus on EFS

(open that course link to get detailed overflow of exactly what i learned)

---

## 📚 Resources Consumed
- Courses: completed AWS Educate Courses - AWS Management Console, Getting Started With Storage (got badge for getting started with storage)

the simulations are actually pretty nice , i thought we will be given demo accounts to practice but was initially kinda dissapointed that its not the case but this is not bad too , its exactly the same ui 

but its like a little hand-fed / too direct instructions so cant explore much and try out other things but better than oracle's pay to practice (and aws provides free tier without credit card ig - cuz we used it in innoquest hackathon)

i can redo these simulations whenever i kinda need more practice 

could have even completed getting started with compute course but played minecraft ;-;
