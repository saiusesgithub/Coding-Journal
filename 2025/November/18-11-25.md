came home at 5:00 
5:00 to 6:00 - timepass , freshup , relaxation 

6:00 to 7:00 - took out my docker notes from obsidian 
read the doubts, lab 1 notes perfectly , skimmed over lab 2 notes 
(because right now , most important thing is learning commands)

so made a cheatsheet and asked chatgpt explanation about what ever commands i didnt understand and wrote about them in the doubts file of the folder 

also watched this video from youtube (I REALLY LEARNT A LOT , THIS SINGLE 8 MINUTE VIDEO IS BETTER THAN SOME COURSES ITSELF) - https://youtu.be/rIrNIzy6U_g?si=w9cPhM2bYAOFq89f

## REWATCH THAT VIDEO AND ADD NOTES TO OBSIDIAN 

took a little break from 7:00 to 7:30 - songs and reels

continued from 7:30 to 8:10 

8:10 to 8:50 - dinner and some timepass 

started from 8:50 again - 
explored other docker courses etc before building a project 

like by the end of this month , my goal is to deploy a project using docker and aws
before starting , i need stronger foundations 

so searched for courses and found one on linkedin learning (its like a professional course , a set of courses has to be done , ill get seperate certificates for all those + this professional certificate , it also has a project which i'll have to do so handson ) , also the entire professional certificate thing takes like 4 hrs 

ALSO DO HANDS ON PROJECTS ON COGNITIVE CLASS . AI (docker , aws etc)

so claimed linkedin premium trial for 1 month 

need to set alarm to remove cancel my subscription before 18th december 

kinda thought over , should i claim this trial now? cuz i have exams next month so wont be able to completely use the entire 1 month


9:15 to 9:30 - instacks assessment

9:30 to 10:00 - 
kinda wanted to start that linkedin course but convinced myself ill start fresh from tomorrow 
i was already burnt out 

explored about gsoc and app ideas  (studypal (demo name) - vjit study vault remake with ai)
like maybe i should start buidling this app like seriously this time 
like 50 commits etc

and integrate awesome ai features in this 
like imagine i get actual users 

lot of useful data in this -

got interest in flutter projects again 

make a flutter game in flame

10:00 to 11:10 - 
vibe coded that calculator app for 1st task in prodigy internship
and pushed to github 

and wrote this journal


doubts solved in docker - 
(get that list from obsidian , the entire doubts solved part is done today (from like copy app.py , from that part , remaining everything below is done today , and also entire cheatsheet done today))

cloudflare went down for a while so chatgpt , claude wasnt working 
why are all the cloud outrages happening now only when i am learning it

## GET PROBLEMS FROM REDDIT FOR APPS/STARTUP IDEAS

also need to work on that internship apps

app idea - an app that helps you keep track of your free trials and reminds you and like shows the best available free trials for you to claim etc

i thought of an app which has an offline model right , so like it can be used completely offline?
an app already exists but like WITH WAY BETTER FEATURES AND PURPOSE - 
Private Mind (on app store , idk if on play store)

i need to take advantage of people's emotional system , like i need to deeply connect and hit thier emotions 

for example , that po*n qutting app which made millions (completely vibe coded)
these kinda apps really affect your brain and like take advantage of you vunrabilities

example (found on reddit) - App that converts unlocks to pushups - Unlocks and screen time convert into things such as push-ups and reading so you can make up for your compulsive behavior


NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON REDDIT AND WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS MAN 
DONT KEEP POSTPONING STUFF / PROCASTINATING TRYING TO BE PERFECT 


I HAVE SOOOOO MANY VALUBLE VIDEOS IN THE WATCH LATER 
AND I AM JUST FRICKING PROCASTINATING THEM
