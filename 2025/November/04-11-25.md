# 📝 Coding Journal — 04-11-2025

---

## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 04-11-2025
- **Day of Week:**  Tuesday (holiday cuz of some bund)
- **Total Coding Time:** (didnt keep track ;-----;) , keep track from tomorrow , start a timer in background when i start learning/working from tomorrow

- **Main Focus Today:** Complete Getting Started With Compute course on aws educate (and if possible,getting started with networking too, nope , not enough time was left + didnt feel like starting networking course so did a lil bit of getting started with databases)
- **Streak Counter:** Day 3 of learning AWS

---

## 🎯 Daily Goals
- [✅] Complete Getting Started With Compute
- [➖] Complete Getting Started With Network (did a bit of Getting Started With Databases instead)

---

## 📚 Topics Studied / Explored
- Concept : AWS EC2 , AWS RDS

---

## 🏗️ Projects Worked On (internship project)
### Project: *Startup World App*
- **Tasks Completed:** fixed the bug - don't show delete data button for student in sidebar
(list of bugs provided by them)  
- **Challenges Faced:** before that , tried to fix - task is being started but not updating in the dashboard so in progress number of tasks not increasing , the code was really messed up , even claude haiku 4.5 couldnt help , wasted a lot of time on it and moved on

---

## 💡 Solutions / Insights
- Key insight learned today: turns out , this startup world flutter app was created in one single night by vibe coding with cursor (whats why , the code is perfectly organised and widgets are divided and helpers functions are made but some parts of it , even ai cant fix , too messed up)   

- Things I would do differently next time: trying to understand the codebase before diving into the problem?

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Day
- Best thing I accomplished: became the flutter team leader in the internship company (read more below )

---

## 📚 Resources Consumed
- Courses: AWS Educate Getting Started With Compute and Getting Started With Databases(lil bit)

the compute course took a realllllly long time , like i thought i would complete 2 courses today , but that one thing itself took a lot of time , didnt really have enough time to complete networking course (didnt feel like it tbh , so did some part of databases course)
so tomorrow , complete the databases course and networking course and then JUST REVISE SO FAR,
ORGANIZE NOTES, TRY TO UNDERSTAND WEAK POINTS

in the compute course - learnt about - types of compute services, ec2 benefits, architecture , purchasing options , steps to launching ec2 instance(like really deeply) , ec2 instance store vs ebs, scaling and types , lil bit of elastic load balancer (elb)
+ hands-on simulation
(Check the course link for more detailed info)

and in databases course (so far) - types of data, database terms , deployment models , aws database services , in rds - benefits , availability , read replicas , multi - az , backups , costs

---

## 🤔 Reflection
- wasted a lot of time in between the cloud course , kinda felt like a little burnt out , you know trying to do so much in so little time (especially one day) , like its all mostly new stuff so (cloud related)

and wanted to learn other stuff too asap , so explored what i should do after completing these aws badges , first instead of going deep into aws , i should learn other stuff too like some devops tools too and then i can decide whether to go deeper or not and in which one 

explored my devops options , should probably start with docker (moocfi helinski course is available but it will take like minimum 2 months to complete , i dont feel like that amount of time is worth it on docker , like its a tool , not my career , i am not trying to become docker expert or master docker )


then really got worried about this flutter internship , avi kulkarni sir sent me onboarding docs/handover docs - overview of the flutter app 
and a list of bugs to solve 

if i had to work for like 2-3 hours daily, then i feel like its not worth the energy and time 
cuz i am not targetting flutter jobs 
and mostly it will be just ai prompting 

pros of being in internship - internship experience in 2nd year itself - really early 

cons - no time for self learning (cloud , devops , blockchain etc)
and even flutter , i would learn a lot more if i spend time on my personal projects

my message to chatgpt - 
I feel like they are going to give me a lot of work like they want to make me do a lot of work and it's unpaid on top of that so I feel like I won't be able to learn anything like I feel like this internship will block me from learning , so what do you think about the situation should I do is it worth it or should I just leave this internship and work on my skills and get an internship in future because I'm just in second year so I feel like I still have time to get an interesting later if you if I want but I feel like building skills is more important in 2nd year 

lets leave flutter,i am not targetting flutter roles anyway for my job, i am learning aws these days using aws educate, But cloud internship are rare so i thought this would help

I feel I like I am left behind because my friend is currently learning data analyst, that person randomly got an unpaid internship  in data science (not even related to that person's field) so I feel like I left behind like it would really help that person that they did an internship in 2nd year itself 

so I am also a thinking  that if I already do internship in my second year and like my resume will be strong from 2nd year itself

then after some calls later , 
chetan bari sir from HR calls me and says do i want to become the Flutter Team lead cuz avi kulkarni sir said to him it seems that "sai is a hardworking guy and we can make him the lead but before that , we should inform him" 
felt really nice (like avi sir saying i am hardworking guy)

he said you will have a lot of responsibilites like managing an entire team of flutter , 
i have to report to avi kulkarni sir directly, and daily it seems 

then in another meet , be bought some devops people and testing people and said , 
after i fix the bugs , i should connect with them , and they will guide me into taking my code from local -> testing/development -> production 

tbh , now i cant really give up as easily as before , like they actually made me the lead , they trusted me , i can desert the role now , i almost really gave up today evening 

i checked cloud internships on aicte website
SO MANYY LIKE MAN I WAS SHOCKED ,
2 flutter internships 
more than 15-20+ cloud internships ( as low as 4 weeks - 6 months , with everything in bw , like 16 weeks , 3 months etc )

now as i became the team lead , i need to act like a leader like taking initiative , these skills would also help me with devup lead and in future , other club lead things

but this would look really good on resume ig - 
flutter interns leader / manager 
(led x amount of people , fixed these stuff , reduced stuff by this much)

- [] READ ALL OLDER AWS EDUCATE NOTES AND LIKE save some compute materials in obsidian(tabs open in chrome) , for every chapter , make sure all materials are saved and also REORGANISE NOTES AND CLEAN IT UP
- [] flutter internship work 


---

RANDOM THOUGHTS / TODOS (SEPERATE THEM INTO ANOTHER FILE ON GITHUB , LIKE TODO LIST ON GITHUB )

Apply for all flutter internships in internshala

Instgram saved and youtube watch later and youtube liked videos HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES AND KNOWLEDGE 

also manikanata Made a fake account on instagram, followed all tech related ppl for tips and information and news etc
DO THAT BRUH


Vibe coding apps , Startup , Free lancing

SO MANY MORE CLOUD INTERNSHIPS IN AICTE THAN FLUTTER

# ankur warikoo short - generalization better than specialization these days

Blockchain 
Ask vijay bro can i learn other stuff and just do this to get certificate etc
ask him about this flutter internship too , worth doing?

reach out to people on linkedin for internships / guidance 


# POST ABOUT MY PLAN FOR NOVEMBER,OCTOBER REVIEW on linkedin

every month end , update my resume and make month summarizing note in this coding journal itself 

JAVA

DSA
LEETCODE
CODECHEF
HACKER RANK
harsha internship
2 months Holidays for internship

also need to start stock market learning, german again!

Message koushik whether i should start leetcode along with my other stuff
ask for his suggestion?

Current flutter Internship - Ask about offer letter and what to do now and what kind of certificate will be provided (aicte thing or thier own)

Also apply for other internships (Like 5 internships daily etc)

Blockchain 
Ask vijay bro can i learn other stuff and just do this to get certificate etc
like learning solidity and just writing exams for the sake of getting certificate

Automation - 
Automate the creation of day wise journal file (along with template) automatically

Todo list in github - 
I am forgetting stuff and losing track of todos like improve github, linkedin etc

organise browser bookmarks

# i am ignoring/procrastinatin the most important tasks like reflection on the journey
