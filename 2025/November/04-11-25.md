# 📝 Coding Journal — 04-11-2025

---

## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 04-11-2025
- **Day of Week:**  Tuesday (holiday cuz of some bund)
- **Total Coding Time:** (didnt keep track ;-----;) , keep track from tomorrow , start a timer in background when i start learning/working from tomorrow

- **Main Focus Today:** Complete Getting Started With Compute course on aws educate (and if possible,getting started with networking too, nope , not enough time was left + didnt feel like starting networking course so did a lil bit of getting started with databases)
- **Streak Counter:** Day 3 of learning AWS

---

## 🎯 Daily Goals
- [✅] Complete Getting Started With Compute
- [➖] Complete Getting Started With Network (did a bit of Getting Started With Databases instead)

---

## 📚 Topics Studied / Explored
- Concept : AWS EC2 , AWS RDS

---

## 🏗️ Projects Worked On (internship project)
### Project: *Startup World App*
- **Tasks Completed:** fixed the bug - don't show delete data button for student in sidebar
(list of bugs provided by them)  
- **Challenges Faced:** before that , tried to fix - task is being started but not updating in the dashboard so in progress number of tasks not increasing , the code was really messed up , even claude haiku 4.5 couldnt help , wasted a lot of time on it and moved on

---

## 💡 Solutions / Insights
- Key insight learned today: turns out , this startup world flutter app was created in one single night by vibe coding with cursor (whats why , the code is perfectly organised and widgets are divided and helpers functions are made but some parts of it , even ai cant fix , too messed up)   

- Things I would do differently next time: trying to understand the codebase before diving into the problem?

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Day
- Best thing I accomplished: became the flutter team leader in the internship company (read more below )

---

## 💭 Random Thoughts
- (e.g., “Coding at night feels more productive, should shift schedule?”)  

---

## 📚 Resources Consumed
- Courses: AWS Educate Getting Started With Compute and Getting Started With Databases(lil bit)

the compute course took a realllllly long time , like i thought i would complete 2 courses today , but that one thing itself took a lot of time , didnt really have enough time to complete networking course (didnt feel like it tbh , so did some part of databases course)
so tomorrow , complete the databases course and networking course and then JUST REVISE SO FAR,
ORGANIZE NOTES, TRY TO UNDERSTAND WEAK POINTS
---

## 🤔 Reflection
- What went well today? (e.g., “Stayed consistent with daily journal”)
