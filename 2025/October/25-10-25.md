### FIX THIS

---

completed study jams (labs , did 15ish today)
did half of arcade

explored about winning prizes too in arcade 

WATCH YOUTUBE A LOT MORE FOR THESE KIND OF OPPURTUNITIES AND COMPETITIONS ETC
and for like free courses etc

thoughts - 
Maybe convert vjit study vault into supabase

ideas revolving around my head -
Something related to Blockchain 
Dino game/level devil game in flame+flutter 
Try out dress ai app flutter
Hackhunt web scraper app flutter

Build your own x like Blockchain

Make a list of skills to learn and project ideas and keep updating it so that i will have my thoughts and ideas in one place 

i am starting aws cloud from 1st nov 
until then 
27,28,29,30,31
5 days

i could continue building flutter apps 
or focus on like deep web scraping 
or learn basics of blockchain like basic smart contracts
(explore about that algorand study jams)

but like deep scraping is kinda useless for me like there are no jobs even related to scraping 
its just for personal projects and kinda startups? 

instead of even scraping and cleaning , i can just get html using requests and feed the data to ai and ask it to clean and structure the data and give it back

## 🐞 Bugs / Problems Faced
- Issue #1: (e.g., “App crashed when filtering products”)  
- Cause: (e.g., “Null pointer due to empty list”)  
- Fix/Attempted Solution: (e.g., “Added null check before rendering list”)  
- Final Resolution:  

---

## 💡 Solutions / Insights
- Key insight learned today: (e.g., “List comprehensions in Python save a lot of code”)  
- “Aha” moment: (e.g., “Realized I can reuse the same widget for multiple screens”)  
- Things I would do differently next time:  

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned
- (e.g., “Don’t forget to clear cache before testing changes in Flutter”)  
- (e.g., “Using Git branches makes experimentation safer”)  

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Day
- Best thing I accomplished: (e.g., “Finally fixed that login bug after 2 days”)  

---

## ⚔️ Biggest Challenge
- Hardest problem today: (e.g., “Debugging async API calls in Dart”)  
- How I approached it: (e.g., “Read official docs and tried breakpoints”)  
- Outcome: (e.g., “Fixed after restructuring FutureBuilder logic”)  

---

## 🔄 Refactor Opportunities
- (e.g., “Database queries can be optimized with indexes”)  
- (e.g., “UI code for ProductCard widget is repetitive, can extract a reusable component”)  

---

## 💭 Random Thoughts
- (e.g., “Coding at night feels more productive, should shift schedule?”)
