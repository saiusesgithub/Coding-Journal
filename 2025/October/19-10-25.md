## ü§î Reflection
COMPLETED THIS - 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-foundations/

completed the entire github foundations part 1 course from microsoft learn
chatgpt said part 1 is enough for the github foundations exam and suggested to use microsoft learn instead of datacamp or others
so started and kept doing on microsoft learn\
(the hands on were awesome tho like step by step checking and updating instructions , AMAZING!! )

took notes of every small thing (kinda felt useless because even i didnt read all of it properly and probably even i am never gonna read it but yeah idk felt like timewaste kinda)

some parts were a little bit too complex to understand like some are too devops focused so ignored those and some were kinda useless for me like enterprise and business stuff etc so ignored those too

finally completed the course (got microsoft badge/trophy -> can be shown as certificate (but it mentions part 1) , thought i will complete the github foundations cert today too and post both of them on linkedin)

did some searching and research and found out
GITHUB FOUNDATIONS CERTIFICATE FREE VOUCHER IS NOT AVAILABLE NOW (cuz they are switching some platforms it seems so thay have paused vouchers)

BRUH , ALL THAT HARDWORK (i mean i did learn a lot but would have been better off learning from youtube and would have understood better)
as it was reading part , didnt really focus and read properly , read lightly and moved on 

MAN REALLY DISSAPOINTED
yesterday that oci labs thing was dissapointing and today this thing bruh

- start writing this diary gradually from morning , like step by step
