## 🤔 Reflection

- didn't do anything coding related , somewhat build resume (searched templates for a long time) and realised man i dont have a lot of skills to show in the skills section 
(i am really behind for a second year student ;----; , i should really start doing stuff fast like lock in)
- most of the time spent on devup ppt presentation for tomorrow and some time on ecell video edit
