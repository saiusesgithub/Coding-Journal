## 🏗️ Projects Worked On
### Project: *Vjit Study Vault*
- **Tasks Completed:** Completely revamped the ui , looks amazing now
- **Features Implemented:** better ui and some small fixes
- **Commits/Pushes:** only 2 commits to ui-overhaul branch but big ones (mostly just ai generated code :/)
- **Challenges Faced:** completely only used ai generation today , didnt code anything , could have explored ui libraries but felt not productive spending any more time on flutter as i am not gonna get job on it 

### Project: *Explainify*
- **Tasks Completed:** built the entire app start to end (v1.0 , pretty simple app , ai generated but understood everything)
- **Features Implemented:** entire app , sending code , gemini api , explains about code 
- **Commits/Pushes:** 5 commits pushed to GitHub repo (pretty big ones , i mean there is only 1 page)

## 💭 Random Thoughts
- felt like wasting time on flutter (can go deep but like literally no use, ai generating really good ai and even complete apps) , our intrests and passion doesnt matter , demand matters

---

## 🌟 Inspiration Board
- [Link / Screenshot / Idea] (e.g., “Saw a Dribbble design I want to try”)  

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- GitHub Contributions Today: 7 (+2 but on that devup society website code sent by faizan)

---

## 🤔 Reflection
- no proper learning plan like i decided i am not gonna focus on flutter in future like job wise so i am not even interested to go deep cuz no use , even for internships , this level is fine 
- didn't get a lot of time as i had to take some DSS club tech team interviews today and also some DEVUP society meets and devup society website , and then also wasted a lot of time cuz didnt have proper time constrained schedule and no measurable goals like completing these many videos etc 
- CREATE TIMETABLE AND ROADMAP ASAP
---

## 🗓️ Plan for Tomorrow
- change logo for vjit study vault , build v2.0 , update readme and todo (also post on linkedin about it)
- polish some older apps with readme's  
- plan roadmap and create resume and start applying for INTERNSHIPS
