## 🤔 Reflection
- What went well today? (e.g., “Stayed consistent with daily journal”)  
- What could be improved? (e.g., “Got distracted by social media”)  
- Did I stick to my plan?  


in the morning (in bus) , kinda watched a lil bit of that youtube prep video for oci foundations , realised he focused on older version of the test and topics really didnt match with my prep
the content is good and better teaching than the oci own guys but not useful in this exam context 
for general cloud knowledge, its nice 

after coming home , wasted time from 5:00 to 6:30 BRUHHHHHHHH
REELS AND SHORTS , gotta reduce this time 

6:30 to 7:30 - wrote that OCI foundations exam (didnt focus on networking , that was my weak spot but yeah they asked 1 or 2 questions and focused on more simple things)
kinda easy tbh
i got 90%
but like its focused on theory , i didnt get any handson experience (wanted to , but cant cuz of that paywall :< )

7:30 to 8:00 
had to write that useless instacks assessment

8:00 to 9:30 - dinner + phone calls + timepass scrolling 

from 9:30 to 12:10 - registered for that blockchain study jams and google study jams thing
and kinda researched if its worth reading and actually doing study jams 

not really
found resources like
aws educate
aws skillbuilder 

they DO give badges/certs but not like official certifications
just cert/badge of completing this course 

too much time wasted on this google study jams ngl
ig i just gotta dedicate these 10 days for these only
