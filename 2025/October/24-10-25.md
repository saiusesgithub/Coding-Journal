Project idea -
App like my closet but for like clothing trying out

You can also try different hairstyles and beard styles and different accessories etc

Learn fastapi+beautifulsoup one day

When i dont have much time 
Fix old apps and make them better

After making all these apps

Like 6-7 app screenshots
1 screenshot per day
Side by side
Along with thier logo added on the top of photo like put the screenshot in a frame

CS50 work push it onto GitHub
