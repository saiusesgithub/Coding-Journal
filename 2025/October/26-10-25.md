## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 26-10-25  
- **Day of Week:**  Sunday
- **Total Coding Time:** above average , got a lot of work done (but still wasted lot of time cuz no proper target today)

- **Streak Counter:** Day 2 of learning web scraping / building hackradar app 

---

## 📚 Topics Studied / Explored

## 🏗️ Projects Worked On
### Project: *Hackradar - Backend*
- **Commits/Pushes:** 5 commits (actually big and meaningful ones) 
- **Challenges Faced:** couldn't hardcode class values to scrape cuz they keep changing and are auto generated by react it seems so it became a little harder to get by searching for closest text and choosing next element to get to required element
- **Next Steps:** integrate into the flutter app (try to make using flutterviz or nova this time (ui))

- **Tasks Completed/Features Implemented:** - 
Commits on Oct 26, 2025
Added print statements to display scraping progress in terminal

Refactor scraping functions to improve error management and switched to safer method of getting data by eliminating hard coded values

Updated logic so that instead of fetching API every time someone clicks on a hackathon for data, while scraping hackathons, its page is opened and data about that specific hackathon is also scraped…

Refactor hackathon data model and cleaned up scraping functions

Implement hackathon data scraping for a specific selected hackathon (like getting more data of a particular hackathon by opening its page)

## 🐞 Bugs / Problems Faced
- Issue #1: Errors while scraping  
- Cause: tags with the specified classes(hardcoded) are not found cuz they keep changing dynamically 
- Fix: search for closest text to the element and pick the next element to get to required element

---

## 💡 Solutions / Insights
- beauitful soup isnt even really required , i can do everything with just playwright  

---

## 🔄 Refactor Opportunities
- its opening a new chromium instance for EVERY single hackathon to fetch its details so wasting a lot of time  

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- Total Lines of Code (approx):  150-180ish?
- GitHub Contributions Today:  5 meaningful and huge ones

---

## 🗓️ Plan for Tomorrow
- Try to complete the hackradar flutter app 
- cleanup browser bookmarks from whatsapp (add them to bookmarks on chrome)

## THINGS TO GET ON TRACK ASAP -
- github profile
- linkedin profile
- portfolio
- resume
and apply for flutter internships asap
