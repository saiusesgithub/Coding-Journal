well one of the best days of the entire month

first, got selected into algorand blockchain club but that was expected anyway 
(post on linkedin about it that - starting a new position at ABC vjit)

next thing , going to participate in that appathon tomorrow (lords college) 
its an app based hackathon so finally its time for my flutter skills to shine

had some discussions about that
and then i got a whatsapp message today evening at around 4:30 that i was gonna have an orientation session at 6:30

so until 6:30, discussed and searched ideas for tomorrows hackathon

at 6:30 joined the meet 
there were only like around 10 ppl (most of them are data analyst interns , i am the only flutter guy and there is one more n8n automation guy)

so they basically explained about the platform 

so in startup world , i need to like submit what work i have done on day to day basis like title , description of work done , completed or in progress etc
and they said i need to have atleast 80% attendance in it
(kinda felt uncomfortable at this point like i am not used to being constrained but its for the good tbh , if i start early , ill get used to corporate culture )

they will send the offer letter within 10 days to starting internship so i thought i got selected hence the orientation (later i got full confirmation)

then they started explaining about thier projects
mainly smart cookie - smartcookie.in

its like a college/school/education related product so they provide services like campx for vjit 
its like a pointing system where students and teachers have points and they can like reward points to each other and they can buy stuff with the coupons etc

one thing i realised is ui really doesnt matter in some places
like in this website, ui sucks but mainly the focus is in backend 
like there is so much work to implement this kind of backend 

the production service got some error , so some guy name avi kulkarni joined the meet (ig he is like the ceo/cfo or like in a big position)
he ordered the other ppl (their company ppl to do stuff and like kinda a little bit shouted on them)
i felt a little uncomfortable (really not a good introduction to corporate world)

but he talked nice to us (he wanted to assign work to us asap instead of wasting any time)

he gave me his number and asked to send my resume (it was an american number and he is an elder guy , look friendly only on his whatsapp dp)

he called me and said he will connect me to the flutter team leader so that i can get work started (he talked nice only to me , i was supposed to call him, i forgot , i said sorry sir , he said ehh no problem no problem dont worry)

then DEVUP meet 
faizan called and asked me to join
i joined and there were some seniors (graduated seniors ig)
they asked me to introduce myself , i told im sai srujan , 2nd year IT,vjit and i started my journey way before btech with c and python , did flutter in ending of first year , planning to switch to cloud/devops now

they asked some questions like - 
why do you want to switch from development to deployment (like from coding to non coding)
asked me to explain about my latest project (explained about hackradar)
challenges i faced while building apps
if i am a team lead and work is slowed down in my team , what actions will i take 

he gave me advice to look into hosting into play store (for that experience)

when he asked , do you have any questions for us?
i asked about internships

on platforms like internshala , for like every post , there are 1000+ interns,
how do you standout and get noticed

he said its based on luck , like a lot of 3rd and 4th years who are good at coding still werent able to do internships but he said dont give up , keep applying 

and then i asked what about unpaid internships , are they worth doing?
he said it depends on you , if you feel like you are learning anything new or useful then its worth it or else its better to leave

meeting done (felt like my english is pretty good , just need to get more practice speaking)

and then i got multiple calls from the company and they like said - 
the flutter team leader is useless , forget him

he said you have good experience in flutter right 
i will talk to someone and he will handover the flutter project to you 

WTF AM I BECOMING THE FLUTTER TEAM LEAD???
this will teach me so much about production code and like deploying to play store(i hope so)

he said ill work on an app called startup world - 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bpsi.startupworld&pcampaignid=web_share

this is it ig 
tbh ill am confident that ill be able to learn whatever needed to build this

one thing i am kinda worried about is 
what if the internship work becomes too heavy like what if i am not able to learn anything due to lack of time
then is it worth it? (as its unpaid)
as the senior said , if it feels like useless or interferring with my roadmap , i can just resign 

(also ask them some questions like will the internship completion letter look like those aicte branded ones or company related and also is there any chance to get paid after some months if my performance is good as i am the flutter lead right now ig so i am doing a lot of work)

as soon as i get the offer letter (put it in linkedin and share it to swetha mam and prasad sir :> )


man everything is going good so far
like i really felt i am going in the right direction / on the right track so far 

participating in hackathons ,
lot of self learning , 
good gpa , 
internship already , 
a good developer mindset (like good kind of overthinking and perfectionist) ,
got selected as content team member for freshers , 
money/business/different and unique and practical/logical mindset

really feeling proud of myself

ngl all this at once is kinda feeling overwhelming but ill pull through it , i am over thinking tbh , take a deep breath and cool down
