## 🤔 Reflection

did 15 google study jams 
and then mostly timepass

searched for some portfolios, and found one that was good mix of simplicity and good looking 
really tried to recreate this one, literally got the entire html code but harder to add/remove new stuff to the structure and after some time looking at it , felt really plain - https://www.mamboleoo.be/

so started recreating this - https://yashitanamdeo.github.io/
got the code and kinda working 
spent some time vibe coding to add my data
kinda worked no problem but it was using gastby framework , really old and kinda slow (too many node modules)
so spent a lot of time converting the entire code base to astro 
no progress like errors kept coming 
wasted too much time vibe coding man.........

also felt a real urge of starting java/kotlin and like building something 
these days , started seeing ai being used in cloud and devops too

like that aws outrage a couple of days ago?,
aws replaced 40% of its cloud team with ai it seems 

keeping that aside
i wanted to add more unique technologies to my github readme and portfolio 

and i need to keep up consistent github activity like green boxes thing
i need consistent activity on that

i cant get that by cloud
like cloud and devops projects are kinda invisible 

so i need to learn something else along with cloud too
i was thinking as i know flutter , i can learn kotlin/java cuz react native does same thing as flutter but native is different and can be useful

but i should learn technologies which give internships easily tbh
like data analytics etc?????
or like mainly how to use ai
like how to really DEEPLY USE ai like prompt engineering and other stuff like agentic ai etc
tools like n8n and creating own ai agents..

that would be more useful than kotlin/java tbh

also 
i need to build atleast ONE PRODUCTION LEVEL project
like i should have active users 
it would be like gold on resume if i have actual users

man i really need to work on vjit study vault thing 
i have literally ignored/neglected golden oppurtunity

I COULD HAVE ADVERTISED IT FOR THE FIRST YEARS AND WOULD HAVE GOTTEN REAL USERS 
but i just neglected
atleast for thier 2nd sem i need to do it

first sem starting would LITERALLY HAVE BEEN PERFECT
they would get used to having something like this from the begenning 
but i literally lost the chance with my own hands

BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh

also explore quantum computing and niche stuff like 
.net , rust? 
also actually do that blockchain thing
and learn about blockchain
