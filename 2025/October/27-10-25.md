## 🏗️ Projects Worked On
### Project: *HackRadar Flutter App*
- **Features Implemented:** built the core flutter app 
- **Commits/Pushes:** 7 commits
- **Next Steps:** build other pages like settings, build scraping for upcoming hackathons and build that page too in flutter app and when we click on more details of a hackathon , build that page too 

- **Tasks Completed:** 
so basically built the core flutter app which fetches data from supabase and displays (ui is really good this time)

#### commits - 
Add additional hackathon details to the swipeable card in live hackathons page

Implement live hackathons page with card swiper and integrate Supabase for data fetching; add SwipeableCard widget

Integrate Supabase and dotenv for environment variable management;

Add live hackathons page and integrate card swiper component; update app theme and homepage structure

Add custom theme data for the application and imported fonts

Implement homepage screen and update main app structure

first commit

but didnt use that fastapi end point at all
supabase integration felt easier and safer tbh cuz we need to seperately host api service on another platform like render/vercel and then fetch 

maybe just advertise backend as "api is made available for everyone" (but not used in this app)

---

## 💡 Insights/Lessons Learned

Actually understood about dedicated theme file and integration and also seperation of widgets into thier own files and even got hands on experince with using .env files and flutter_dotenv

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Day

- the ui/design is really good , usage of that swipeable card and the border around the card really made it look impressive 

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

- Total Lines of Code (approx):  around 200 lines (some ai help but very less , just during that builders thing like dynamically building the screen after getting data from supabase) 
- GitHub Contributions Today: 7 commits

## 🤔 Reflection

i am kinda again falling into this trap of building small flutter apps 
like none of these are big and like projects that i am proud of 
i am able to build these projects in 2 days => not good/complex enough projects

also there are so many libraries , i can build so many more apps but it doesnt have good roi
there are better things i can do with this time rather than building more and more *small* flutter apps which wont get me anywhere

also they are starting quantum computing club in our college it seems
maybe i should learn about that too (like a side skill , just to put on resume , if good scope in future, then continue learning)

## How many of my planned goals did I accomplish today? 
- ( 1 accomplished / 2 planned )
