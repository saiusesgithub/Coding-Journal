---

## ⚔️ Biggest Challenge
- Hardest problem today: Understanding Kubernetes part of the course 
but like no need to learn everything in such short time, take it slow no need to worry

---

## 💭 Random Thoughts

- Cloud felt more hard to understand/learn than other stuff like coding languages but then its good for me because more ppl cant do it then 

but felt like not learning anything perfectly and there are not a lot of alternate resources on youtube especially for oracle cloud 
but like i dont need to master everything at once , i need to resive everything before taking the exam once 

- not posting on linked in properly man LIKE BRUHHHHHHHHH
missed devup inaguration event, IEEE quiz event, pitchquest event twice etc 
and even then not posting my photos , just posting certificate photos.
ALSO POST MONTHLY REVIEW OF CODING PROGRESS
