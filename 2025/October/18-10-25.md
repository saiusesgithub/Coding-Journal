## 🤔 Reflection

- quickly completed oci thoery course , there are some skills gaps(didnt understand all the concepts) and also just watched videos today , didnt read notes (directly copy pasted from chatgpt) but i will read it anyway for the exam and also 

all the concepts arent equally important , there are some which constitute 80% of cloud practice (80-20 rule)
so i just need to really focus on those like storage and network (really need to work on networks) and some basics like compartments etc (still confused) but i got this 

worst case scenario - i focus on only 1 topic per day to perfect it but stil,slow but steady , i will gain grip

AND THEN REALISED , I NEED TO PAY FOR OCI LABS
29usd for practice or i can get free OCI account with 300$ free credits but i need credit card BRUHHHHHH
i was really excited for hands on sessions so that i would get more clarity and grip

my options are somehow getting free account using credit card or just completing without doing labs (exam is only theory)

thats the problem with learning cloud , you cant practice anything for free 
(atleast i have that 100$ in azure via github student pack)

also planned to start github foundation certificate from tomorrow , possible to complete it in 2 days , in sunday and monday (monday is diwali so holiday) - i will complete and get 2 certs (oracle and github)
