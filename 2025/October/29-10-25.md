## 🤔 Reflection
really confused what to do next (like from tomorrow) like there are so many resources and so many paths i can take 
i am really overthinking tbh 

i feel like i should build 1 more big flutter app along with vjit study vault and hackhunt but i feel like its not worth it tbh , i can do something better with that time , there is not enough ROI on the time spent 

also need to do that blockchain study jams (algorand)

i was thinking i would do cloud and blockchain together parallel-ly from nov 1st 
but until then what?

30,31st
i could really focus and build one app OR i can get my portfolio, resume, linkedin, github ready 
and some other stuff ready like organizing bookmarks in laptop , planning other activities like german learning and stock market learning and reading books plan etc...

maybe i should do other Oracle race to cert courses?
2 days left
the only thing i can do (like actually watch everything and do ) is oracle ai foundations
(i need to learn basics of ai anyway at some point in the future so this might be good course for that??)

i can do any course if i just want to copy in the exam and get certificate but i really dont wanna do it like i feel guilty and its really not worth anything without the actual skills
