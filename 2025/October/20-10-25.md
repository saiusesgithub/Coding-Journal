## 🤔 Reflection/Random Thoughts

- woke up in the morning , today's main goal was completing OCI cert and then idk , so i thought ill build the portfolio website and resume and get everything on track 

but first in the morning, i focused on building portfolio , did some research on chatgpt etc and decided i am gonna build android emulator styled portfolio 
started building and wasted like an hour on it and then came to realization that it isnt possible with complete vibe coding and even if i manually coded , it will take a long time , i need to create custom animations and components

then didnt know what else to do 
spent some time figuring out roadmap

explored some devops courses like docker courses and almost started but then ai suggested that devops is built on top of cloud so cloud should be learnt first
and explored cloud platforms for some time 

thought i will start cloud fresh from nov 1 , i have 10 days
explored what i can do in these days 
kinda decided on learning fastapi and beautifulsoup and building a web scraper api for hackathons and integrating it into hackhunt/hackradar app and hosting the api publicly too apart from app integration

that felt like the most new skills i can learn in these 10 days (i can add fastapi and beatuifulsoup to resume/github/portfolio) 
it will be kinda a good practice like full stack - 
scraping + backend api + flutter frontend

also searching a lot for certificates
i am kinda focusing more on certificates than quality learning
like so much quality content is available on youtube, instead i am doing those half baked courses for useless cert
i should use more youtube for my learning 


spent lot of time exploring stuff and then decided to make a normal portfolio 
planned to fork an existing portfolio from github and to update it with my data 
so started searching for best portfolios online with github code 

SPENT LIKE HOURS SEARCHING
found many good ones but no github code
most of them are way too basic or literally ai generated 
some are like way tooo complex and kinda laggy on pc itself let alone phone 

also in the morning , i thought of android emulator kinda portfolio right?
found windows/macos/linux emulator styled portfolios LIKE WITH ACTUAL CODE

thought , im done , i am making these but then realised they are not suited for portfolio like icons seems like a very small part of the website , it seems like a game or experience , not a portfolio
most people will miss clicking on my content , it isnt visible immediately so it will get ignored/missed
so scraped that idea too 

one windows emulator is like tooooooo PERFECT
like literally felt like using a VM 
i was really impressed man like wtf 
so cool
but then found out , he is a youtuber and he spent 4 FRICKING YEARS building this thing
dayummmmmmmm
comments were filled with impressed people 
but then , he spent 4 years building this , but he probably wont get a job cuz of this 
its just a side project

remembered the quote (kinda) - passion doesnt earn you money , demand does
so shut the fu*k up and learn what is in demand to earn money
(true if you in the starting stage , after you have solid career and financial freedom , then you can do what you like cuz you are already settled, then you can follow your passion , after getting a strong foundation)

also saw a lot of websites today 
and i have been ignoring web dev until now thinking its basically useless 
but after looking at so many websites , web dev is how you express your work 
its like the instagram/youtube of coding , its like content creation
its how you showcase you work

web dev projects are impressive and everyone easily recognizes them and they are products like countable
compared to cloud/devops stuff where a normal person doesnt easily look at that as a * project * like he doesnt consider cloud/devops thing as a project cuz its not a product like not countable and not like visible 

and like got fascinated by just how big this web dev field is like apart from languages
there are so many frameworks like reactbits, 21st dev , frame motion , 3js , animejs and gsap and many more animation engines etc 

tbh , even after ai , after todays thing , i am kinda convinced that ai isnt gonna replace web devs 
its good at building quick websites / boilerplate code but lacks creativity tbh like really 
it can only do what it has been trained on 

it will replace some people as it gets better but not the majority
like how drag and drop website builders didnt replace web devs 

hmm then even app dev has scope?
not as a career tbh 
app dev pay is way less than web dev pay and way less jobs like not even comparable to web dev no. of jobs


idk man
lets see what happens 
i need to stick to one thing really tightly

mostly cloud/devops
other options - 
java + dsa (and maybe app dev in java,backend stuff like spring) - probably do this in 3rd year
blockchain (a skill tbh , not career)
cybersecurity (...)

LETS HOPE FOR THE BEST
:>>>>>>>>>>


also found a video on youtube about oci foundations exam prep
like 2.5 ish hour video
which completely prepares you for oci foundations exam

AND MAN HE IS EXPLANING SO MUCH BETTER THAN oracle's own videos 
kinda planned to complete test today but didnt revise notes and felt lazy so planned to watch this video tomorrow , revise notes and write the test 

i just need to focus on some topics really hard/deeply like all the network part and some fundamentals like compartments etc
