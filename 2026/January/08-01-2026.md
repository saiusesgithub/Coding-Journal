## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 08-01-2026
- **Day of Week:** Thursday  
- **Total Coding Time:** 3 hrs (2 hours doing stuff + 1 hour setting up notes and writing today's and yesterday's notes)  
- **Main Focus Today:** (e.g., “Implement login flow in Flutter app”)  
- **Streak Counter:** DevOps Lock-In Day 2

Woke up at 8:00
8:00 to 8:30 idk , was sleepy played clash roayle

8:30 to 9:10  - Did 2 chapters in zerodha varsity and watched respective videos too (wrote notes in whatsapp as notes app which was dedicated to stock market wasnt setup yet)

9:10 to 11:00 - idk what i did - listened to songs and went out and had breakfast and other timepass

11:00 to 12:40 - completed day 2 in chatgpt devops lock-in plan , copy pasted notes in obsidian , 
realised i have kinda forgotten docker commands but good revision today , i still remember concepts tho so commands are just a google away 

12:40 to 3:00 - ???? played minecraft and lunch and etc MAN I AM WASTING SO MUCH TIME , I COULD BE SO MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE

3:00 to 4:20 - fixed up the notes of previous 2 days devops coding notes 

didnt read eveyrthing properly , still need to revise everything once more and solve doubts ,
also made a github repo and pushed notes (storing this notes on github publicly - MAYBE MAKE THIS AS A PUBLIC DEVOPS NOTES REPO OR LIKE MAKE A PUBLIC DEVOPS ROADMAP IN THE README) AND LIKE MAN - INSTEAD OF LINKING TO RESOURCES , GIVE THE PROMPT with clear instructiosn SO THAT THEY CAN COPY PASTE IN CHATGPT AND LEARN THE SAME THING in the same way i learnt (like just using chatgpt for learning instead of other resources , like instead of watching videos , doing courses , first chatgpt can make a plan and then explain everything one by one in that plan and like give tasks and tests etc , act like a teacher) 

THIS PROMPT PROVIDING FOR LEARNING IS A NEW THING, MAYBE I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO USES IT RN AND MAYBE I CAN KINDA MAKE A PROJECT OUT OF IT AND POPULARIZE IT

4:20 to 6:30 - IDKKKKKKKKKKKKK BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHH

6:30 to 7:30 german - wasnt the most productive german session but yeah
first planned stuff (instead of juggling 3 resouces at once - dw german , udemy and duolingo , just sticking to udemy as main source and duolingo as backup / secondary source)
did the revision thing in duolingo (just revised really basic stuff tho like the starting stuff , didnt revise latest / harder stuff , i remember all the stuff it revised without even revision)
and in udemy - did 4-5 lessons in udemy course (could have done way more but wasnt really focused ;-;)

7:30 to 9:30 - idk bath + dinner + timepass 

9:30 to 10:30 - setup german and stock market notes and wrote notes previous 2 days stock market and today's german notes (stock market - notesnook , german - simplenote)

really felt i wasted a lot more time on youtube today cuz i disabled the youtube blocking app today

# STOCK MARKET JOURNAL TODAY - 

Completed chapter 2 and 3 in zerodha varsity module 1

Chapters Covered:
2️⃣ Regulators
3️⃣ Market Intermediaries

Market participants include retail investors, institutions, AMCs, and foreign investors
SEBI is the main regulator — purpose is investor protection + fair markets
Regulation exists to avoid manipulation by big players
CRAs (CRISIL, ICRA, CARE) decide creditworthiness for debt
Debenture trustees ensure companies don’t default on debenture promises
Shares are held digitally via DEMAT, not physically
NSDL & CDSL are the only depositories (no major difference)
Investors interact via DPs, not directly with depositories
Brokers are the entry point to markets (trading + reports + settlement)
Trading, Demat, and Bank accounts are separate but linked
Clearing corporations guarantee settlement and prevent defaults

# CODING JOURNAL TODAY (DEVOPS) - 

📅 Day 2 — Docker Core

Environment: Ubuntu EC2 (terminal-only)

✅ What I Did

Installed Docker manually on Ubuntu EC2
Verified Docker daemon with systemctl
Ran hello-world to confirm Docker setup
Worked entirely via terminal using sudo docker
Built and ran Dockerfile #1 (minimal)
Used FROM and CMD
Observed container start → execute → exit
Removed containers and images manually
Built and ran Dockerfile #2 (slightly real)
Created a shell script using nano
Made the script executable
Installed dependencies using RUN
Copied files using COPY
Executed script using CMD
Built Dockerfile #3 (intentionally broken)
Image built successfully
Container failed at runtime
Debugged permission denied error
Fixed it using RUN chmod +x
Rebuilt image and verified success
Faced and fixed issues:
Forgot sudo while running Docker commands
Missing execute permission inside the image
Did a rebuild-from-memory test:
Created everything from scratch
Introduced a failure intentionally
Debugged and fixed it without notes

🧠 What I Learned

Image ≠ Container
Dockerfile ≠ Image
Build time (RUN) ≠ Run time (CMD, ENTRYPOINT)
Containers are ephemeral; images persist
Docker only accesses files inside the build context
Most Docker errors are actually Linux errors
Build success does not guarantee runtime success
Permissions inside the image matter

Docker behavior is predictable and debuggable

Status: ✅ Docker no longer feels magical
