# CODING JOURNAL

📅 **Day 5 — Deployment to Cloud VM (Manual CD)**

**Environment:** Ubuntu EC2 (cloud VM), Docker Engine, terminal-only (no dashboards, no automation)


## ✅ What I Did

SSH’d into a real Ubuntu EC2 instance to use as a long-lived deployment machine  
Verified Docker installation, Docker daemon status, and daemon auto-start on boot  
Fixed Docker permission issues by adding the user to the Docker group to eliminate `sudo docker` dependency  

Cloned my existing Docker-based application repository directly onto the VM  
Inspected the Dockerfile and runtime shell script before deployment  
Built the Docker image manually on the VM instead of relying on CI  

Ran the container in detached mode and observed it exit immediately  
Used `docker logs` to understand that the container stopped because the main process exited  
Modified the runtime script to keep the main process alive and redeployed the container  

Verified the container stayed running after SSH session termination  
Confirmed the app was now truly running independently of my terminal  

Practiced reading historical logs using `docker logs`  
Practiced streaming live logs using `docker logs -f` and detaching safely  
Used logs as the primary debugging signal instead of guessing  

Intentionally killed the running container and observed exit code behavior  
Restarted the container manually without rebuilding the image  
Verified recovery using logs and container state inspection  

Restarted the Docker daemon and observed that running containers did not auto-restart  
Manually recovered the application after daemon restart  
Rebooted the entire VM and observed that only disk state survived  

Recovered the application manually after VM reboot using existing container definitions  
Confirmed understanding of runtime state vs disk state  

Performed a full rebuild-from-memory test:
Opened a fresh SSH session without notes  
Inspected VM and Docker state calmly  
Removed containers and images intentionally  
Rebuilt the image from the repository  
Redeployed the container successfully  
Injected multiple failures (container kill, Docker restart)  
Recovered cleanly each time using logs and Docker commands  

## 🧠 What I Learned

Deployment is about keeping systems alive, not just running commands  
A VM is a stateful machine where memory resets but disk persists  
SSH is not deployment; long-lived systems must survive disconnects  

Containers are just Linux processes wrapped by Docker  
A container exits when its main process exits, even with exit code 0  
Detached mode does not imply persistence or uptime  

Logs are the only reliable source of truth during deployment and failure  
Exit codes communicate how and why processes terminated  
Manual recovery must be possible before automation is introduced  

Docker does not guarantee uptime by default  
Running containers do not survive Docker daemon restarts  
Runtime state does not survive VM reboots  

Disk state (images, container definitions, repositories) is the foundation of recovery  
Deployment confidence comes from rebuilding runtime state repeatedly  

Rebuild-from-memory is the true test of deployment understanding  
Calm inspection and deliberate recovery matter more than automation  

**Status:** ✅ I can manually deploy, break, observe, and recover a Dockerized app on a real cloud VM  
**Result:** ✅ Deployment now feels operational, predictable, and owned rather than fragile or magical

# TIME BASED JOURNAL 

OVERSLEPT TODAY BRUH
woke up at 9:20 - 

9:20 to 10:30
Read first chapter of atomic habits

As this is my first time after a long time 

Wasted a lot of time  
Read the book once without taking notes

Then setup notes app 
And then read once again lightly and spent way too much time taking notes

Like should i write this in notes or not?
Spent way too much time on that

10:30 to 11:00 clash royale and timepass ;-;

11:00 to 11:30 - breakfast + youtube

11:30 to 1:10 - coding , completed day 5, CI (tbh didnt do anything new today , just some ideas thats it , i could really complete day 6 today too or i could focus on portfolio or stuff like devup website today) , really need to ask chatgpt to reconsider the plan and increase the hardness , like its considering 6hrs per day but i am completing that stuff in less than 2 hrs everyday , need to level up the hardness ig,  also ignoring ports and networking so far , really need to spend one day on that

1:10 to 1:40 
Timepass clash royale

1:40 to 2:20 
Finalised book tracking app 
Decided storygraph 
Deleted old account 
Made new account and added all the books (books i have and to read list)
Spent way too much scanning and adding books i have

Still not satisfied with storygraph tho 

Maybe vibe code my own app/website using books api ?

2:20 to 3:20 
Lunch + timepass bruh 
For so long
YOUTUBE SHORTS

3:20 to 5:15 

started my portfolio  development 

Oof
First had to decide - 
1) from scratch using components (vibe coding + 21st dev etc)

2) use someone's website directly and replace (if code is publicly available on github)

3) design using ai vibecoders like loveable and then vibe coding using GitHub copilot 

I had a BOOKMARKS list of inspiration portfolios so looked at every single one and idk didnt get any conclusion from that so screw that 

Explored components on 21st dev and reactbits and found so many good ones

So decided first option and so got the nextjs skeleton ready and saved backgrounds from 21st dev and reactbits

Thinking maybe ill do 1 part at a time 
Like the background one day, navbar one day, skills section one day, hero section one day etc

5:20 to 6:30
Timepass BRUH 

SNACKS BREAK
THEN SONGS UNTIL 6:00
THEN INSTRAGRAM 

really need to start blocking apps 

6:30 to 7:10 
German notes of yesterday udemy

Wrote about dates (how to pronounce numbers in dates) ,days, months,seasons

And about nouns der die das etc

7:10 to 7:40
Stock market
1 chapter
About stock market jargon 
Mainly focused on 
Shorting 

TOOK LONG NOTES THO 
TOO DETAILED

7:40 to 8:20
Bath etc

8:20 to 9:20 - dinner and timepass bruh 

9:20 to 10:40 - spent way too much deciding on the background for portfolio website like man i am just not able to decide bruh , finally decided on plain black background and the colour effect while i move my cursor but just couldnt get the config right , i can customise values and i am not getting that perfect look

started writing this journal from 10:40 to 11:
