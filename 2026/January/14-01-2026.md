# CODING JOURNAL 

📅 **Day 8 — Docker Networking & Ports**

**Environment:** Local machine (Docker Engine), terminal-only, Docker CLI, Docker Compose

## ✅ What I Did

Started the day by explicitly locking the **Docker networking mental model** before running any commands
Reasoned about containers as isolated network namespaces rather than “apps with ports”
Clearly separated the three traffic directions: **host → container**, **container → container**, and **container → host (rare)**

Built a real long-running Python HTTP server instead of using hello-world
Confirmed that a container appearing “stuck” in the terminal is expected behavior for foreground services
Observed that `docker ps` showing `PORTS 3000/tcp` does **not** mean the host can reach the service

Ran the container **without port mapping** and verified the service was unreachable from the host
Added correct port mapping (`-p host:container`) and confirmed host access worked immediately
Experimented with port remapping and verified that Docker blindly forwards traffic to the specified internal port

Intentionally broke host access by:

* Mapping the wrong internal port
* Curling the wrong host port
* Relying on `EXPOSE` without `-p`

Verified that `EXPOSE` is documentation only and does not create any network bridge
Locked the concept that **port mappings are explicit translation bridges, not automatic exposure**

Discovered and debugged the most critical networking failure:

* Bound the server to `127.0.0.1`
* Observed container running but unreachable from host
* Fixed by rebinding the service to `0.0.0.0`

Proved that loopback addresses are **namespace-local** and do not receive traffic forwarded by Docker

Moved to **container ↔ container networking** using a user-defined Docker network
Created a shared bridge network and attached multiple containers manually

Encountered a real DNS failure due to **network name mismatch**
Learned that Docker DNS resolution is **strictly scoped to the same network** and exact names matter

Confirmed that container-to-container communication works using **container/service names**, not IPs
Verified that `localhost` always fails between containers because it never crosses namespaces

Observed real-world readiness timing:

* First request failed
* Second request succeeded
* Learned that process start ≠ service readiness

Rebuilt the entire system using **Docker Compose**, deliberately slowing down to avoid abstraction confusion
Started from a clean directory and rebuilt server, Dockerfile, and image from scratch

Validated the container manually before introducing Compose to maintain confidence
Introduced Docker Compose incrementally:

* Minimal `docker-compose.yml`
* Observed automatic network creation
* Inspected the Compose-created network

Added `ports:` in Compose and verified it affected **host access only**
Added a client service to prove internal DNS and service-name resolution

Observed Compose lifecycle behavior:

* Client exited with code `0` after success
* Server exited with code `137` due to Compose teardown
* Confirmed this was expected behavior, not a crash

Concluded the day by consolidating **failure cases** instead of adding new features
Converted each observed mistake into a predictable diagnostic pattern

## 🧠 What I Learned

Docker networking is not complex — it is misunderstood due to missing mental models
Each container is effectively its own machine with its own network namespace

Ports do not expose services; they **translate traffic** between host and container
A running container does not imply a reachable service

`EXPOSE` communicates intent but performs no networking action
Explicit port mapping is always required for host access

Binding matters more than mapping
Binding to `127.0.0.1` silently breaks both host → container and container → container traffic

Internal Docker networking is simpler than host networking
Containers on the same network communicate directly using names and internal ports

Docker DNS is network-scoped and deterministic
Service names resolve only within the same Docker network

`localhost` is always local to the current namespace and is a common source of bugs

Startup order does not guarantee readiness
Real systems require retries, health checks, or explicit waiting

Docker Compose does not introduce new networking rules
It automates network creation, DNS registration, and container attachment

Exit codes must be interpreted in context
A container exiting does not imply failure if it was intentionally stopped

The most reliable debugging approach is:

* Identify traffic direction
* Verify binding
* Verify network membership
* Verify port translation (only if host is involved)

**Status:** ✅ I can reason about Docker networking without relying on trial-and-error
**Result:** ✅ Ports, networks, and service discovery now feel mechanical, predictable, and non-magical

# GERMAN JOURNAL 

Planned to unit 1 revision actually 
But idk didnt feel like revision so started unit 2
Completed 2.1,2.2,2.3 (didnt do speaking drill, ill do all those after unit 2 completed for revision)

du wohnst (you live)

er wohnt
sie wohnt
es wohnt

wir wohnen (we live)
ihr wohnt (you live - plural) 
Sie wohnen (you live formal)

# TIME BASED JOURNAL

Woke up at 7:30
Got the book by my side
Tried to read but eyes were too sleepy couldn't read at all
Couldnt even open eyes and see book properly 

So set alarm until 7:50 and also phone had no charge so put phone on charge and slept

I SHOULD GET OFF THE BED AND SIT ON STUDY CHAIR OR SMTH AND LOCK IN FROM TOMORROW WITHOUT WASTING ANY TIME


7:50 to 8:30
Book reading 
Completed one chapter in atomic habits 

Learnt about pointing and calling and habits scorecard 

Didnt take too much notes today, took just what is needed (good)

Actually start implementing pointing and calling and habits scorecard from today

(as i am writing this journal in the night , i kinda making the habit score card in morning in another whatsapp chat but kinda forgot about it as the day went on , this kinda things are better suited to be written in a offline book)


8:30 to 9:00
timepass - 
Songs 
Knew about pointing out and calling etc but i still needed some brain activation and freshness and relaxation (maybe these are excuses my brain made up?, idk man)

9:00 to 9:20
Opened laptop and planned for day 8 but had no charge so couldn't start

9:20 to 10:20 - 
(didnt write in whatsapp chat what i did in this block of time exactly )

10:20 to 11:05
Completed until step 2 in day 8 

Docker ports 
Kinda understood now 

Still a lil bit confused bw
Difference bw 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0

Generally need to learn about networking and api's like fastapi and nginx stuff
we have networking related subject in our college ig????

11:05 to 11:40
brush , freshup
Then breakfast
And then 10 min youtube

11:40 to 1:30
Completed remaining of day 8

Really hard
Still not perfect
Need to reread notes

Not completely focused
Looked at dogs in bw (like wth man how did i get so distracted?)

downloaded house flipper game and installed on pc (;-;)
idk got the random urge to play that game 

Was really waiting to play house flipper
Not really focused 

Also zomato order and other life stuff until 1:30


1:30 to 5:00 - 
the most unproductive block 

lunch etc and then played house flipper and then timepass like yt , instagram , clash royale etc

my schedule isnt tight enough , i am getting all the planned stuff done within a day like coding , stock market , german so i am finding time to play games and timepass :/

atleast could have done one productive stuff in this timeframe like could have gotten one full task completed or like could have updated the resume in this time or even could have revised stuff 

man i am really neglecting revision of stuff like coding notes, german notes , stock market notes etc 
revision is more important than learning sometiems cuz if i dont remember then whats the use of learning?


5:00 to 6:35
Stock market

10-15 minutes break in between

Wasnt really fast or laser focused

Completed 2 lessons

Also used chatgpt to summarise notes and solve doubts etc ( better this way, do this more often, solve doubts etc right there and then )

Realised that i dont need to take this much notes while of writing notes (in between of 1st chapter of today) and only took important notes from that point (didnt write down useless definitions which i already knew and didnt focus on perfect notes cuz no one gonna read it ,its not for others,just for myself)

Varsity Videos pending tho - after completing module 1 , gotta binge watch varsity videos 


6:35 - 7:10
German
Planned to unit 1 revision actually 

But idk didnt feel like revision so started unit 2

Completed 2.1,2.2,2.3 (didnt do speaking drill, ill do all those after unit 2 completed for revision)

Forgetting Numbers MANNN BRUH 

And also , the verbs are really confusing man wth is that order

also not doing Daily german revision in night (while writing journal etc)

7:10 to 7:45 

kinda got into mood of developing devup website

So searched dss and gdg website 
Pretty simple 

I can use minimalist neo brutalist but i shouldnt over use it 

And then idk distracted for 5 minutes , surfed internet randomly 

tbh , i didnt really get anything by looking at these websites , i just looked at them for timepass and curiosity and general web surfing

And then bath

7:45 to 9:15 - 
listened to songs 
and then dinner 
and then continued youtube until 9:15 
bruhhhhhhhhhhh
i am setting these limits but extending while eating and after eating, continuing yt shorts ;-;


9:15 to 10:15 - planned devup society website structure and general pages and what to have in each page etc

10:15 to 12:00 - 

summarised today coding notes and pushed notes onto github 

writing this journal
man i am delaying this journal for too long 
like more than 90 min for journal??

idk man its too late to write 12 and 13th journal
ill do it later ig? hopefully??? ;--;



hoarding website on chrome again man (open tabs - too many , thinking - "ill deal with this later" )

also need to focus on ecwoc and swoc man 
i am delaying it too much 



--- 
also made this rough plan yesterday - 

14th - devops lock in day 8 + german unit 1 revision + stock market 9,10 + atomic habits 4th + (give tasks to DevUp people to research about website + start ecwoc/swoc) 

so day 8 completed perfectly
OH SHIT, MAN I DIDNT REALISE I HAD PLANNED TO START SWOC/ECWOC TODAY
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DO IT TOMORROW OR SMTH AHHH SHIT 
ALMOST PERFECT DAY

i could have done this instead of playing house flipper man

15th - devops lock in day 9 + start german unit 2 udemy + stock market 11,12 + atomic habits 5th + (DevUp website) + start ecwoc/swoc (missed to do swoc/ecwoc on 14th ;-;)

16th - devops lock in day 10 + German unit 2 udemy + stock market 13,14 + atomic habits 6th + (DevUp website)

17th - devops lock in day summary and revision and pack up + German summary/revision until now + stock market 15 + summary/revision until now + atomic habits 7th + (DevUp website) , ask chatgpt to quiz me on german and stock market etc

18th - future devops/cloud planning + future german planning + stock market planning + atomic habits 8th (+ revision/summary until now) 

now apart from daily 4 tasks -

Portfolio development
DevUp website development
AWS cloud club event plan 
ECWOC/SWOC

```after each journal entry , pass the journal to chatgpt and ask it to analyse and summarise and etc like get some proper results / rating from it AND ask it to make a todo list to things from todays journal and things to improve/take action on ```
