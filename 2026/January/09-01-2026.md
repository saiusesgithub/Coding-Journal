# CODING JOURNAL - 

📅 **Day 3 — Docker Compose, ENV & Systems Thinking**

**Environment:** Ubuntu EC2 (terminal-only, Docker + Docker Compose installed manually)

---

## ✅ What I Did

Installed Docker Compose manually as a standalone binary
Created two services (Service A and Service B) using shell scripts
Built and ran both services as standalone containers first
Fixed Docker daemon permission issues using sudo
Confirmed scripts run correctly inside containers

Created `docker-compose.yml` from scratch
Defined multiple services using `build`
Started multi-container system using docker-compose up
Started system in detached mode and checked status using docker-compose ps
Stopped and removed containers using docker-compose down

Verified container-to-container communication
Used service names as DNS hostnames
Confirmed containers communicate over Compose network
Observed difference between localhost and service-name networking

Worked with environment variables:
Used inline `environment` variables
Used `.env` file with `env_file`
Changed application behavior without rebuilding images
Learned when rebuild is required vs not required

Faced and fixed Compose/YAML errors:
Left `environment:` empty → validation error
Placed `env_file` at wrong indentation → schema error
Fixed errors by correcting YAML structure

Tested dependency behavior using `depends_on`
Observed that `depends_on` only controls start order
Proved that `depends_on` does NOT guarantee readiness
Built a file-based readiness signal
Observed dependent service fail even with `depends_on` present
Fixed system by adding explicit wait logic

Took a theory test and identified conceptual gaps
Corrected misconceptions around services, localhost, ports, and readiness

Did a practical rebuild-from-memory test:
Created a new directory
Built a multi-container system from scratch
Introduced a dependency failure intentionally
Fixed it without referring to notes

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Docker Compose orchestrates containers; it does not replace Docker
Dockerfile builds images; Compose runs containers
A service is a container runtime definition
Service name = DNS hostname inside the Compose network

`localhost` inside a container refers to the container itself
Ports are for host ↔ container, not container ↔ container
Containers communicate via Docker network, not exposed ports

ENV variables control runtime behavior
Changing ENV does not require image rebuild
Changing application code requires image rebuild

Empty or mis-indented YAML blocks cause Compose validation errors
Config errors and runtime errors are different and must be debugged differently

`depends_on` ≠ readiness
Container start ≠ service ready
Startup order does not guarantee dependency availability

False-positive health checks are dangerous
Green logs do not guarantee a correct system

Containers are parts of a system, not isolated tools

---

**Status:** ✅ Containers now feel like a connected system, not isolated commands
**Result:** ✅ Docker Compose feels mechanical and debuggable, not magical

7:30 am  to 8:30 am - idk  just wokeup 
Timepass listened to songs until 8:00
Played clash royale from 8:00 to 8:30

i mean i can't focus / do productive work every single living minute , i am a human after all 
trying to do work like a machine is the main reason for burn out's so tryna keep that away but i shouldnt take advantage of that fact and not focus at all 
gotta give my best 

8:30 to 9:00 
Completed 1 chapter in module 1 zerodha varsity + wrote notes in notesnook app

The IPO market part 1

Capex

9:00 to 10:30 

Clash royale  ;-;
Instagram BRUH (unconsiously , just opened once and spent like 30 min in it , man i gotta get back the app blocking)
breakfast etc 

10:30 to 11:45 
coding - did until hour 3 (completed hour 3) in today's coding plan 

Docker compose
Felt really great
Actually learning stuff instead of certificate collecting

11:45 to 1:00 
Minecraft
wanted to relax for like 30 min and that became 1hr 15 min ;-;

1:05 to 1:25 
Did german udemy lessons

1.4,1.5,1.6,1.7 (didn't do speaking drill lessons for all these)

1:25 to 2:00 
Wrote today's udemy notes 

Really felt nice like i am actually learning stuff 
Felt proud 
Actual progress instead of time waste 

Learnt numbers 1 to 100 perfectly, just need practice

2:00 to 3:50 - lunch + timepass again bruh

started at 3:50 again cuz laptop didnt have charge (kinda planned to start at 3:20 but no charge so timepassed even more)

3:50 to 5:20 - 
completed today's hour 4 and 5 
really stressed out 
reasons - 
took a theory test and i couldnt explain sh*t + my english speaking sucked (dictated answers into chatgpt), i got everything wrong , didnt understand stuff , and then kinda took a hands on no notes test - couldnt do it cuz idk shell and no hands on practice with docker-composy.yml (docker too) , need to spend way more time but like i just started learning it from 2-3 days so its fine - not perfecting it yet (mastering is not possible this early)

really gotta work hard from now on , more focus 

5:20 to 6:30 - timewaste again 

6:30 to 7:05
Stock market another chapter ipo part 2  + notes + watched respective zerodha video

7:30 to 8:10

Not focused

I think i am gonna give up 
Not putting enough effort to get selected ig 

Like its like posting on social media And Getting likes and reach consistently

started writing this journal after 10:00 

----

felt like i was pretty productive today and then while writing this journal 
i realised how much time i wasted today , i cannot waste no time , i am a human after all but i gotta reduce the time wasted , its too much rn , gotta put some of it to good use

also feeling like - 
i am not spending enough time coding like the hours i am coding per day is very less 
i should code this much in normal college days itself 

NOT VACATION , i am really under performing keeping in mind that this is vacation 

remember that , there are some people who will spend thier entire day on coding 
like thier entire day , thier brain is only focused on coding , NOTHING ELSE, ONLY CODING FOR ENTIRE DAY, i am in competition with those kinda people man

really gotta level up my game
