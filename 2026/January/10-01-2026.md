# CODING JOURNAL - 

📅 **Day 4 — CI/CD Fundamentals (Automation over Manual Work)**

**Environment:** Local machine + GitHub Actions (ephemeral Ubuntu Linux runners)

---

## ✅ What I Did

Chose GitHub Actions as the CI tool to avoid setup friction and focus purely on CI fundamentals
Reused my Day 2 Docker repository (single Dockerfile + shell script) instead of creating a new project
Verified the Docker image builds and runs correctly locally before introducing CI

Created the GitHub Actions workflow directory structure from scratch
Created a new CI workflow file without copying any existing templates
Defined a CI pipeline that triggers automatically on every push to the repository

Built the CI pipeline incrementally:
Defined the workflow identity and trigger
Defined a single job mapped to one Ubuntu runner
Understood that one job equals one fresh Linux VM
Added steps sequentially instead of writing the full pipeline at once

Added a checkout step to explicitly pull repository code into the runner
Confirmed that runners start with an empty workspace and require checkout
Added a Docker build step to enforce image build correctness inside CI

Pushed the workflow and observed the first successful CI run
Read Docker build logs line by line in GitHub Actions
Confirmed CI Docker behavior exactly matched local Docker behavior

Intentionally broke the Dockerfile by referencing a non-existent file
Pushed broken code to trigger CI failure
Observed CI fail with a Docker error and non-zero exit code
Practiced reading CI logs without guessing or panic

Fixed the Dockerfile and pushed the correction
Observed CI automatically rerun and pass successfully
Verified the full red ❌ → green ✅ CI loop

Deleted the existing workflow and rebuilt the entire CI pipeline from memory
Recreated triggers, jobs, runners, and steps without referencing notes
Triggered CI successfully after rebuild
Broke the Dockerfile again intentionally
Observed CI failure again
Fixed the Dockerfile and restored a green pipeline


## 🧠 What I Learned

CI is not a tool but automated execution on a clean Linux machine
CI runs on ephemeral Ubuntu runners with no cached state or local assumptions
GitHub Actions jobs represent machines, not abstract tasks
Steps are sequential commands executed on the same runner

CI success and failure are determined entirely by exit codes
Docker build failure directly causes CI failure
CI failures are expected signals, not errors to fear

Checkout is mandatory because runners start with empty filesystems
Local success is irrelevant unless the pipeline also succeeds
CI enforces Dockerfile correctness strictly

Docker builds can accidentally depend on host file permissions
Explicit permission handling inside Dockerfiles is required for portability
CI exposes hidden assumptions made during local development

Rebuild-from-memory is the real proof of understanding, not green pipelines
Automation replaces trust with verification

**Status:** ✅ CI now feels like a Linux machine running commands, not copied YAML
**Result:** ✅ Every push is automatically validated; failures are readable and debuggable

# TIME BASED JOURNAL 

8:05 to 8:40 - 
Varsity module 1 chapter 6
Introduction to stock markets completed 

Was a pretty big chapter so took long

Also i am writing notes like old times again 
Copy pasting huge paragraphs of useless stuff
Need to sit down and trim it

8:40 to 9:15 - 
Timepass clash royale and youtube until 9:15

9:15 to 9:30 
Planned about linkedin post

9:30 to 10:00 
Songs and timepass

10:00 to 10:35

Played clash royale in bw for 15 minutes
And then got coding plan ready day 4 and got step 1 done (notes concept)

10:35 to 11:00 - breakfast and stuff

11:00 to 12:25
Completed day 4
CI 
learnt a lot of stuff about CI
Github actions
Didnt go deep or complex hands on but theory is solid and did light hands on 

Thinking maybe ill do 5th day schedule today too or else i can setup stuff as i am free today 

Wrote notes too

12:25 to 2:00 - idk timepass and lunch 
BRUHHH WASTING SO MUCH TIME

before writing todays journal , i thought i was pretty productive today and didnt waste anytime but now i am realising how muchc time i am wasting

2:00 to 2:30
German udemy

1.8,1.9,1.10,1.11 and 1.11 quiz

Notes taking pending 
Really getting challenging
Need to spend time practicing instead of just watching videos and writing notes

Revision important 
Forgot numbers , need to revise

tomorrow - 
write notes 
Watch the final summary video

Do all the practices 
And verify i completed everything perfectly in unit 1 and then move on 

Also write ai assisted test (ask ai to create the test and quiz me) on unit 1

2:30 to 3:15
Read introduction chapter of atomic habits 

And had chat with chatgpt and decided in which app i am gonna take notes

So decided zoho notes

I am gonna write down important lessons / points from each book 
Digital summarised library

1 book per month 
(Also buy new books)

atomic habits -> 20 chapters are there, 20 days in jan

Done 
But i am holding back myself to follow this rule ;-;
If i wanna read more, then this rule shouldnt stop me bruh 

Also start reading as soon i wake up 
on bed , Instead of stock market from now on
Start reading

3:15 to 4:30 - ???? TIMEPASS ;---;

4:30 to 4:55 - 

Stock market 
Another lesson 
About stock market indexes + wrote notes

4:55 to 6:00 - BRUHHHHHHHHHHH WASTED SO MUCH TIME TODAY , SUCH AN UNPRODUCTIVE DAY 
not having timetable was the issue 
loose timetable > no timetable 
sometimes loose timetable > strict / packed timetable cuz ill get burned out with strict time table 

6:00 to 6:20 - idk what to do , kinda confused cuz no proper list of tasks to do , kinda planned to get all the linkedin posts ready for future but realised for like posts like devops lock in , i need to get all the data and it will be better to post in that instant than preparing

6:20 to 7:00 - 
Spent some time improving linkedin profile 
(Mainly spent lot of time on the banner)

7:00 to 7:50 - 
So I found a random github account and they had certificates repo and that gave me a idea
Ill store all my certificates and resume and resume versions in one github repo 

Then i thought ill add linkedin certificates from there (after creating that repo and gathering certificates)

So spent some time making github repo and finding some certificates
didnt find all of them yet but progress

7:50 to 8:20 - bath and dinner AND ?? TIMEPASS MANNNNNNNNNNNNNN
WASTED SO MUCH FKING TIME TODAY

9:20 to 10:30 - continued searching for certifications and organisation and finally pushed to github with all the certs i could remember and i could find (time well spent tho , in future it will be useful , my github is so stacked )


10:30 to 11:00 - listened to songs and timepass
11:00 to 11:30 - writing this journal 

also didnt really feel like i wrote proper time based journal today 
writing journal in whatsapp - i am just writing timings and nothing else (no thoughts and plans etc)
before i used to look at those timings and used to write the journal myself and reflect and used to write thoughts at night 

but now i am just copy pasting all the messages from whatsapp and trimming unnecessary stuff

i am not capturing as many thoughts i used to 
also cutting out some thoguhts from whatsapp cuz they dont fit in time based journal
and leaving them in whatsapp in hope of coming back to them in future but NEVER ACTUALLY TOUCHING THEM

even if i come back to them later , i should atleast mention it in the journal 
like i got that idea today , i should atleast acknowledge it in the journal

ROUGH GEMINI BREAKDOWN OF THE DAY (didnt really give a good prompt - just to get an idea , integrate a better version of this into future journal entries)

💡 Reality Check
You wrote multiple times: "BRUHHH WASTING SO MUCH TIME".

However, look at the data: You clocked in nearly 7 hours and 45 minutes of productive work.

Most people work a 9-5 job (8 hours) and are only productive for about 4 of those hours.

You built a GitHub repo, learned CI/CD, studied German, read a book, and studied the stock market.

The Issue: The issue isn't that you didn't work; it's that your rest periods were unstructured ("idk what to do"), which creates a feeling of guilt rather than relaxation.

NAH NAH THE ENDING PART IS JUST POSITIVE GASLIGHTING , I SHOULDNT FALL FOR IT 
I ONLYYYYYYYY SPENT 7HRS DOING USEFUL WORK TODAY
BRUH WASTED HALF OF THE ENTIRE DAY COME ON MANNNN NOT COOL 

really gotta do something about this 
should have atleast coded a lil bit instead of all this timepass
