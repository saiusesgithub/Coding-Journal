# 📝 Coding Journal — 07-01-2026

---

## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 07-01-2026 
- **Day of Week:** Wednesday (Sem End Holidays) 
- **Total Coding Time:** 2 hrs  

- **Main Focus Today:** (e.g., “Implement login flow in Flutter app”)

- **Streak Counter:** DevOps Lock-In Day 1

---
## Today's Focus - 

### Linux & SSH Foundations (DevOps Lock-In)

**Focus:** Building real server confidence using Linux (terminal-only).

Today was entirely hands-on and executed on a **real Ubuntu EC2 instance** via **SSH (key-based authentication)** — no GUI tools, no browser SSH, no shortcuts.

---

### 🔧 What I Did

* Launched and connected to a live Linux server using SSH
* Navigated the filesystem confidently using `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `/`, `~`, `..`
* Created a structured workspace and managed files/directories end-to-end
* Read files and logs using `cat`, `less`, `tail`, `tail -f`
* Understood file creation and redirection using `touch`, `>`, `>>`
* Deleted files and directories safely using `rm`, `rm -r`, `rmdir`

---

### 🔐 Permissions (Deep Dive)

* Built a clear mental model of Linux permissions (**r / w / x**) for **files vs directories**
* Inspected permissions using `ls -l` and `ls -al`
* Intentionally broke permissions (`chmod -x`, `chmod -r`) and fixed them
* Understood why **execute permission** is required to enter directories
* Used both symbolic and numeric `chmod` (`+x`, `755`, `777`) with awareness of security risks

---

### ⚙️ Processes & Services

* Understood the difference between **processes** and **system services**
* Monitored processes using `ps`, `ps aux`, `top`
* Created foreground and background processes (`sleep &`)
* Identified processes via PID and terminated them using `kill`
* Managed system services using `systemctl` (`status`, `start`, `stop`)
* Intentionally stopped and restarted the `ssh` service and recovered cleanly

---

### 📜 Logs

* Learned the difference between **service status** and **system logs**
* Read real system logs using `journalctl`, `journalctl -u ssh`, `tail -f`
* Understood why elevated permissions are required to access system logs
* Interpreted real SSH authentication and restart events

---

### 💣 Break & Rebuild

* Intentionally broke services and file permissions
* Rebuilt everything **from memory without notes**, including:

  * Files
  * Permissions
  * Processes
  * Services
  * Logs

---

### ✅ Outcome

I can now confidently say:

> **“I can SSH into a Linux server, navigate without fear, manage files and permissions, control processes, handle services, and read system logs.”**

**Status:** Day 1 completed successfully
**Approach:** Slow, deep, and correct — focused on understanding, not speed.

so from morning to 2:00 pm - didnt get anything done cuz i had to go out to send off my grandparents 
by 2:00 , came back , had my lunch and timepassed a lot like clash of clans and webseries (NOT PROUD OF WASTING TIME)

locked in from 2:00 to 4:00 with a 10 minute break in between 
completed everything i have mentioned above (NOTES PENDING THO , roughly took notes, didnt format etc)

Really learnt some new stuff in such a short amount of time like a lot of new linux commands

but now as i writing this journal (it's night 10:50) , i dont really feel like i struggled today but as chatgpt said if i am not struggling then i am not learning anything new, maybe i gotta increase the intensity

like it estimated day 1 plan to take 6 hrs but it only took 2 hrs :/


and then from 4 to 5:30 - 
Played minecraft and bloodstrike ;----; , i really need to get a strict schedule or else this timewaste is not gonna stop 

kinda did make a rough time table before 2:00pm today but as it was planned from morning , i couldnt really follow it for today so did random stuff today 


5:30 to 6:45

explored about Social Winter Of Code and other open source programs 

felt really stressed, overwhelmed , tierd, confused 

Didn't feel like i did anything useful 
Un-satisfied with return based on the time spent (not enough return on time investment)

6:45 to 7:00 - took a songs break 
7:00 to 7:40 - kinda planned stock market and actually started stock market plan - 
completed lesson 1 in unit 1 of zerodha varsity (i kinda knew about that already but redoing everything) 

in the '1. Introduction to Stock Markets' Module
completed '1. The Need to Invest' Chapter and also watched the related youtube video 

learnt about - why invest? , diffrence in corpus if invested vs not invested (+ if invested in different asset classes)
learnt about different asset classes 
advantages and disadvantages of each asset class 
combination of different asset classes is the best choice (diversifying) 

DIDN'T take stock market notes too properly 

7:40 to 10:30 - 
Devup society meet 
dinner 
timepass for a little bit , GOT SELECTED in Elite Coders Winter Of Code (seems way legit , organised than Social Winter Of Code)

didnt start german today tho :/

idk man , i dont remember exactly what happend cuz i am writing this diary at 11:20pm
as this is the first day in this year , its fine 
but from tomorrow , write it gradually from morning , like every 2 hrs or every 1 hr

also i gotta change that rough timetable cuz i packed everything in that like 1.5hr coding and 0.5hr stock market / german non stop, thats NOT gonna happen , my brain will be so cooked , i need actual break for 10 minutes and then i can do german/stock market so need to make those changes

this year didnt start as expected but that doesnt mean i have to ruin the entire year 
i gotta lock in and focus and make this my best year so far

## 💡 Insights

we can actually get our personal projects developed by others by open sourcing it and applying in programs as SWOC , ECWOC as a project

also need to revamp the entire old template , its not really useful 
like for example , in todays jorunal entry , i didnt use that template at all 
like its not suited for my style 
so yeah i need to imrpove that
