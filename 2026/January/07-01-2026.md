# 📝 Coding Journal — 07-01-2026

---

## 📅 Daily Overview
- **Date:** 07-01-2026 
- **Day of Week:** Wednesday (Sem End Holidays) 
- **Total Coding Time:** 2 hrs  

- **Main Focus Today:** (e.g., “Implement login flow in Flutter app”)

- **Streak Counter:** DevOps Lock In Day 1

---
## Today's Focus - 

### Linux & SSH Foundations (DevOps Lock-In)

**Focus:** Building real server confidence using Linux (terminal-only).

Today was entirely hands-on and executed on a **real Ubuntu EC2 instance** via **SSH (key-based authentication)** — no GUI tools, no browser SSH, no shortcuts.

---

### 🔧 What I Did

* Launched and connected to a live Linux server using SSH
* Navigated the filesystem confidently using `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `/`, `~`, `..`
* Created a structured workspace and managed files/directories end-to-end
* Read files and logs using `cat`, `less`, `tail`, `tail -f`
* Understood file creation and redirection using `touch`, `>`, `>>`
* Deleted files and directories safely using `rm`, `rm -r`, `rmdir`

---

### 🔐 Permissions (Deep Dive)

* Built a clear mental model of Linux permissions (**r / w / x**) for **files vs directories**
* Inspected permissions using `ls -l` and `ls -al`
* Intentionally broke permissions (`chmod -x`, `chmod -r`) and fixed them
* Understood why **execute permission** is required to enter directories
* Used both symbolic and numeric `chmod` (`+x`, `755`, `777`) with awareness of security risks

---

### ⚙️ Processes & Services

* Understood the difference between **processes** and **system services**
* Monitored processes using `ps`, `ps aux`, `top`
* Created foreground and background processes (`sleep &`)
* Identified processes via PID and terminated them using `kill`
* Managed system services using `systemctl` (`status`, `start`, `stop`)
* Intentionally stopped and restarted the `ssh` service and recovered cleanly

---

### 📜 Logs

* Learned the difference between **service status** and **system logs**
* Read real system logs using `journalctl`, `journalctl -u ssh`, `tail -f`
* Understood why elevated permissions are required to access system logs
* Interpreted real SSH authentication and restart events

---

### 💣 Break & Rebuild

* Intentionally broke services and file permissions
* Rebuilt everything **from memory without notes**, including:

  * Files
  * Permissions
  * Processes
  * Services
  * Logs

---

### ✅ Outcome

I can now confidently say:

> **“I can SSH into a Linux server, navigate without fear, manage files and permissions, control processes, handle services, and read system logs.”**

**Status:** Day 1 completed successfully
**Approach:** Slow, deep, and correct — focused on understanding, not speed.

so from morning to 2:00 pm - didnt get anything done cuz i had to go out to send off my grandparents 
by 2:00 , came back , had my lunch and timepassed a lot like clash of clans and webseries (NOT PROUD OF WASTING TIME)

locked in from 2:00 to 4:00 with a 10 minute break in between 
completed everything i have mentioned above (NOTES PENDING THO , roughly took notes, didnt format etc)

Really learnt some new stuff in such a short amount of time like a lot of new linux commands

but now as i writing this journal (it's night 10:50) , i dont really feel like i struggled today but as chatgpt said if i am not struggling then i am not learning anything new, maybe i gotta increase the intensity

like it estimated day 1 plan to take 6 hrs but it only took 2 hrs :/


and then from 4 to 5:30 - 
Played minecraft and bloodstrike ;----; , i really need to get a strict schedule or else this timewaste is not gonna stop 

kinda did make a rough time table before 2:00pm today but as it was planned from morning , i couldnt really follow it for today so did random stuff today 


5:30 to 6:45

explored about Social Winter Of Code and other open source programs 

felt really stressed, overwhelmed , tierd, confused 

Didn't feel like i did anything useful 
Un-satisfied with return based on the time spent (not enough return on time investment)

6:45 to 7:00 - took a songs break 
7:00 to 7:40 - kinda planned stock market and actually started stock market thing 
## 🎯 Daily Goals

## 📚 Topics Studied / Explored
- Concept / Algorithm: (e.g., “Binary Search Tree Traversals”)  
- Framework / Library: (e.g., “Explored Flutter Provider package”)  
- Tools Used: (e.g., “Postman for API testing”)  
- Documentation/Articles/Videos: (e.g., “Watched CS50 lecture on SQL”)

- Fix/Attempted Solution: (e.g., “Added null check before rendering list”)  
- Final Resolution:  

---

## 💡 Solutions / Insights
- Key insight learned today: (e.g., “List comprehensions in Python save a lot of code”)  
- “Aha” moment: (e.g., “Realized I can reuse the same widget for multiple screens”)  
- Things I would do differently next time:  

---

## 📘 Lessons Learned
- (e.g., “Don’t forget to clear cache before testing changes in Flutter”)  
- (e.g., “Using Git branches makes experimentation safer”)  

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Day
- Best thing I accomplished: (e.g., “Finally fixed that login bug after 2 days”)  

---

## ⚔️ Biggest Challenge
- Hardest problem today: (e.g., “Debugging async API calls in Dart”)
